A makeshift Troll Warlord. Aka, that ugly girl/dude with a sexy body you'd only fuck with a bag over their head.
/r/jokes
Nice Copy-Pasta xD\n
On the contrary, I think that fiery bitch is more attractive once she shuts the fuck up.
That’s so weird... women normally become more attractive\n\n#when they shut up
*Because she's not stunning any more.\n\nCause and because mean totally different things.
whys op attracted to cartoons? cuz hes a dork
That makes her more attractive. A cum-receptacle for right click gangbangs and nothing more. 
Clap
Meteor hammer fgt
Doesn't look like anything to me.
r/westworld/ What are you referring to ? 
Sure, he's farmed, but not into survivability.\n\nHe's got good XP, but not that much more then opponents (he is 7, invoker is 6, pls is 6, NP is 4, rubick is 4 and lowest is roaming tusk at 3. So it's not massive level advantage either.\n\nCould they have played it better? Yeah, probably. But I still think this is bullshit level of """balance""".
nah [this](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Headress_of_the_Divine_Flame) is the best headpiece + the waifu skirt &amp; sleeves from [this set](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Everlasting_Heat) (although since the immortals release u have to choose between a better skirt or a cool spell effect)
Enchantress is strong first 15 mins breaking news everyone.
actually women are more attractive when silenced!
Cause she can't say no
I don't think Noone said anything there.  All the jokes were Solo and Ramzes and [smiles in russian] was Lil.
to be fair the regen from Doom and Dazzles 2's Es also saved him, or he'd have been  dead around the 20 second mark into the clip.\n\nAfter that it's just OPFrog
Don't be stupid, that game was already lost for Na'vi.
New accounts cant play ranked until a certain level. I dont remember how many games but it's a couple of weeks of even full time playtime iirc.    \n\nAssuming you got someone to do that for you, you still can only calibrate to 3.5k max last I heard. You need 40 games per 1,000 mmr so assuming an unrealistic 100% winrate he would have to play 160games in  "a couple of days" which even that is impossible. \n\nEven an 80% winrate from would be 200 games. \n\nSo that claim he can get a new account to top 100 in a couple days is bullshit.
OPfrog nothing wrong here Clap
This post is about to get messy and I ain't talking about the soccer player
I was gonna say she would be more attractive with her mouth gagged
Meanwhile, Vlads also need to get the +10 dmg from the Morbid Mask, at least, since this item has been "nerfed by power creeping"
O believe any woman is more attractive when silenced. ?
+15% dmg is not the same as +10 dmg
EExactly onlEE and EEdiot would buy onEE.
It's an overused lame joke, like this subreddit.
ye this was totally normal.\n\nfucking baboon
I guarantee you that the game may have gone better if Artstyle didn't shit out a 0-7-0 Dazzle that game aside from the stupid self-grave that's turned into a meme. It's not in the slightest bit 'being stupid' for having a good bit of mockery at Artstyle's Dazzle after that abortion of a performance in a BO1 elimination game.\n\nSource: Navi fan who was there watching it happen live, and who can't forget that game if I tried.
wasn’t there a change that made denying via neutrals less effective? aka clock gets all the gold anyways
Hood of Defiance has the SAME active as Pipe,  Just lesser MR, use it people 
If there was ever a clip less clip worthy...
My takeaway from watching those two when they both were at their top was that Noone tended to win the 1-on-1 matchup, but Sumail did more to win the actual game after that.
who pick phoenix anymore
And then you will want one for urn, one for SR, one for tranquil's... Can't you just click the hero?
I also just check heroes for that as well. I want to know cooldowns as well.\n\nYou can gain a lot of information by clicking on everyone and it doesn't take much time at all once you get used to it. When you're good at the game you'll hardly be looking at your own hero anyways. You don't need to watch yourself move between camps/jungle or kill creeps when you're strong enough that missing CS is unlikely.
don't worry, we'll add in like 3 more diamonds ~~how about buyback~~, and it'll get harder to tell which is which. 
that's not how shower thoughts work. this is just a dumb suggestion.
LET'S GO LGD! WOOOO! WIPE THEM ALL OFF THE FACE OF THIS EARTH!
what if you carry a tp scroll, BoT1, and BoT2 with all having different cooldown time remaining
Lets make custom indicators! It is pointless to see drow's ulti cd anyways, and aura cd could be more useful.
The only reason the update was delayed. Kappa
Lmao playing a phoenix middle vs the cancer mid of the patch at HALF health and he still asks "is he crazy?" Before barely killing him with like 10 hp to spare.\n\nIm not a big RTZ fan but damn what a read.
Hush
I think he was checking his mana.
col will win. Infamous I am not sure. 
Get this shit over with and give me my patch notes
never before have i wanted a tournament to just not happen at all. good job valve
I would take those results as a grain of salt since LFY got trashed by mineski when mineski isnt even in their best form while VG seems doesn't seem to be as strong as 2 months ago.\n\nI'm ready for them to prove us wrong though as I'm excited for a second Ahfu (xnova) in a Chinese team.
I might try drums. It fits with the wind lace. Drums/Treads would give a ton of AS which is more or less how Ench damage is unlocked. \n\nIt's my major disagreement with the concept of phase boots on her. Her damage is throttled by attack speed, not actual damage. 
Blocking Minimap with an add is really annoying.  I can't really parse what's going on in the clip without seeing it.  My brain is trained to look at it.  Was he creating space in this time, what were his teammates doing, why was he running the direction he was?  These things would be clear, if I knew what the fuck was going on outside of his narrow range of vision.
great work COL /s
u seem like a phoenix spammer
So what? That wasn't his point
I don't see the logic in that. We are comparing small items vs cost heavy non-items that only give passive attributes... The smaller items are obviously better.\n\nIf you willing to argue that a 1600 Mythril Hammer (that gives like 24 damage) is worth more for farming than a Hood of Defiance... Then you are simply a dumb carry that probably doesn't fight with his team when he should 
dont be that guy, i dont want a phx mid on my pubs
It's bad, don't listen to shit like this. HP items like sny/skadi give you way way more and your ult heals a percentage base. 
So Slark should just stay in the jungle the entire game and not be seen? Are you daft?
&gt; rtz is the quickest\n\nwaddya mean "rtz is the quickest" lmao there is literally no way of knowing how quick pros check the enemies' items because they all basically take the same time
Kinda reminds me of when I play a core and the friendly neighbourhood position 5 runs up and takes a few last hits from the creeps I'm farmin, I ask him wtf he's dooin and all I get from him is how much gold he needs to finish his next item.\n"Oh shit!"\n"You were gonna buy items this game?!?"\n"Well my fkin bad m8, farm away!"
That right there is why you don't put points in fucking march.
Some would be autistic.
&gt; If you willing to argue that a 1600 Mythril Hammer (that gives like 24 damage) is worth more for farming than a Hood of Defiance...\n\nSure I will. 24 damage is definitelly something. Hood, on the other hand, only gives mdef(not needed for farm) and regen(Slark has regen from his ult).\n\n**Slark has 3 'get out of jail for free' skills**, he doesnt need more deff(you wont permastun a smart slark because of his Q and once out of stun he will use ult and W to get away). He is also kind of guy that expects to snowball and make kills alone and needs that additional damage for that. If it still feels like you need more deff in a particular game, you shouldnt pick Slark in the first place.\n\n&gt; Then you are simply a dumb carry \n\nThanks for reminding me that Dota comunity is full of toxic people. Sometimes I feed like there are no real dota players in this sub.
Custom indicators would enable modification of the game which is not recommended, opening up for third-party customisation may make it easier to access other parts of the game and thus also enable more ways to potentially cheat or exploit the game.
Isn't there a golden border around the flag that hangs down from a dead hero's portrait that indicates if they have BB?
But are his videos any good? 
How have you measured that RTC is the quickest and where is the proof?
imo the reason to go march instead of laser+rocket is because you go jungle after soul ring, freeing up a lane for a support and maximising the amount of gold and xp your team gains on the map. if your team is less competent and coordinated though, like in a pub, I think max laser+rocket is still viable because its just so easy to force your opponent out of lane if you just spam your shit nonstop. It's extremely powerful against an SF for example, 1 high level laser+rocket will take 3/4 of his hp
he got greedy, he should know very well that if he kills the small troll, the larger one will summon skeletons immediately. 
I’m a pro?! :D https://youtu.be/xLw8WWqcboY\n\nI always check items whenever enemys are on the map since my three years of playing.
I hovered over the link and it's an emote, so no, you have no proof for your claim. Thanks for clarifying that.
washed up player still thinks hes some relevant hot sauce berries funnies indeed
he picked Huskar, did you really expect him to make smart decisions?
And if Sumail says something, you know Reddit's listening.
Nope
fuck OFF DDUE
haHAA Bulldog is so funny xDDDDDDDD haHAA TEA EYE WINNER haHAA Win a TI before you balance the game so FUNNY XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD haHAA
Are you that new... 
just olddogs boring meme.. nothin to see here.
Whoa!
getting really annoying tbh, does anyone find this funny i just wanna know ? 
"How do you do, fellow kids?"
That was a mistake. AdmiralBulldog is an ass, and we won't be working with him again!!!
why would he check his mana when he just used rockets and laser? Everything was on CD, he knew tinker can only right click at this point so he checked his items if he has any regen
It's His fucking job !
Hey i'm willing to change my profile pic and nickname to take a spot, just one liiitle problem, im 3k, no big deal tho. Pm me if interested ^not^sure^if^Kappa

this is some retarded shit
Haha... hilarious, but this ain't no t.v. show.   fuck.

weather? wow the newbee guy must be some baboon or some shit.
in pubs? it is
rtz fans always like this. when artour literally said "it's not just me, everybody hates Kuro, it's everyone against him" rtz fans say "lol he was just joking.     \n\nTruth is rtz is really good at dota but he has the emotional intelligence of a baby. Not unlike presidents and CEOs, though.
so it should be climate or something ? i dont get ur joke.
tldr please 
Is this going to be the least exciting year in Dota? Right now it looks like we'll see a repeat of last years Ti final.
Real talk here: does anyone have any idea if icefrog will be helping with artifact balance? And by help I mean have exclusive control.\n\nTo me that literally makes or breaks the game. Icefrog is well known for being the best balance "team" on the planet, valve not so much (not saying they're awful, but just.... Fuck we have a game of 100+ heroes an it's balanced somehow)
Your names are wrong. That is Exodia. \n\nExodius comes as 1 card - A different mon altogether.\n\nhttp://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Exodius_the_Ultimate_Forbidden_Lord

good investment.
It is actually cringe for me haHAA
Thats what i said in one of the posts, he can't keep his composure.
He also earns money, so that kinda motivates him too.
If you mustn't cringe, what do you count as a bad joke?
A legit fucking post with some genuine effort behind it with 26 upvotes and 10 comments. Shows you the value of the most upvoted comments on this sub (zero).
haHAA berry cool
Do I need a PHD to understand this ? ......\n\ni think secret VP are 99% guaranteed newbee about 80%  for liquid it doesn't matter they are the defending champions so they are 100% guaranteed\n\nIf newer teams or underdogs start wining top 4 in majors then the present ranked 5th to 10th will have problems qualifying.\n\nso does this mean if you start the DPC at a high pace you are guaranteed to make it to TI's . so next season some teams may use this advantage and participate heavily.   
i really dont get why he gets invited anywhere , hes blitz level of biased every game except he isnt even a good caster to compensate
Well yes, that's pure passion indeed, but I doubt he would have continued for 5 more years if he hadn't been hired by volvo
Gyazo link, still just a bullshit "joke".
Wow Watson... Both he and I from our exchange were under the assumption he could turn it off - or on - to suit his needs ; not sure you manage the on part intellectually.
SO BAD OMEGALUL
Car dressup game. Gameplay was shit. nfsug1 way superior
Unless you're working with classified information which could cost thousands their lives... You just made me laugh very hard. I just hope it's not your only achievement today.
Huh? RTZ will never win a Ti...
I right click and it clears it. 
Just because I type things you disagree with doesn't mean I am not "chill", I am relaxed as usual.:D\n\n\n\nEvery day is a nice day to have fun, but making factually wrong claims without any proof what so ever, only personal opinion, is stupid.
&gt; I'm not trying to be an ass, just a fellow non-native speaker trying to share.\n\nYea, me too. [](/techiesface) ^^^^^^^^/s
grats for aegis but ill downvote coz the photo is stupid attention, also girls in dota and football is a joke tnx
I not sure If Navi would get anymore DPC points but VP keeps getting anyway. VP trades another big dpc point carrier at the end to Navi to be invited to ti8. Not to mention Navi direct invited to every rest tournaments. What a great time for Navi fans.
This brings me a question: Is IceFrog a direct Valve employee (or owner, why not)?
&gt; ancestor monkeys\n\nbigot much?
Magnus. Its worse than any Tinker or Techies.

valve time,also the frog doesnt tell when he will start that schedule
Ok... If you have no clue what medium is or who you're talking to ; don't try to act patronizing so as to not seem so pathetic. I'm pleased you think highly of yourself despite there being a clear case for the opposite to hold more sway.\nTalk back to me when you grasp basics such as the fact that there's no actual security upgrade from http to https and that SSL is basically useless even against crawlers and swipers.\n\nThis is why you're Watson and will never be Sherlock.\nHave a good day nonetheless Watson.
Hijacking top comment to ask a question: Since Team Liquid have already been guaranteed a spot for TI8 as they are the reigning champions, will the last spot go to the team in 9th place?
According to latin the singular would be Exodium, if the plural is supposed to be Exodia.\n\nOtherwise, if Exodia is singular, Exodiae would be the plural.
I tried to watch those once... He couldn't understand what '+2 sec max stun for CK' meant. I know, everyone makes mistakes, but he was thinking about it out loud for 10 minutes.
Roughly as stupid as misinterpreting obvious jokes as factual claims, no?
I don't think they are moving away from the 18 team format, so 5 more teams from the DPC would get invites.
Holy shit, this looks sketchy as fuck. If it's true, it also looks like he's been using it quite a lot and is acustomed to using it. It really doesn't surprise me - CIS community and all. For me, this is beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nMade mirrors for this, just in case (I suspect if it blows up, he'll delete VODs - other option is he'll try to explain it on twitter).\n\nhttps://streamable.com/sq1gb\n\nhttps://streamable.com/turq0\n\nhttps://streamable.com/my6vi\n\nhttps://streamable.com/v4gvh\n\nhttps://streamable.com/vg2xc

laol very impressive 
keep your stupid memes to your cancer twitch chat and don't spread it in twitter thanks.
The simple fact that you downvote my answers shows the demeanor of a 6 yo.\nFigure out why SHA-1 to SHA-2 switch did Jack &amp; you might be on to something.\nStop being so swaggering when you're a clear as day pretender.
It's 1st February 2018. Reddit vigorously discussing SOME GLOW on the screen of a TIER2 streamer and now ex-pro. What kind of people are these...
It's quite worse than the TI6 one, in my opinion, I keep mine hidden behind the last year's and pretend it doesn't exist.
Not surprising considering it comes from CIS community. They have known for doing something shady like this. NS calling Bulldog degenerated person for casting ESL is fucking no brain while his community is trash.
It's like you're implying that Blitz is a good caster to compensate for his bias. Hilarious!
ALT TAB TO READ CHAT YOU PLEB

This change might not be for us, but for valve, because with frequent patches, it gives more stuff for people to work on and bring more change to them.

finish\n\nratas\n\nplz coment
*Recomment me
The US is one of the most ethnically diverse first world nations. I already play with people of different skin colors when I have full NA lobbies. Pinoys and Russians on USW also aren't that bad.\n\nWe don't hate South Americans for their race, we hate them because most of them are unsupervised delinquent children in net cafes. Dota is their Xbox Live.
NSFW tag, please :)
They should tie up with Facebook. Connect your dota profile to Facebook so that you'll get matched with the players near your area. \n\nEdit: kappa
no\n\nfuck facebook
Does windranger have boobs ?\n
lul
Then you’re indistinguishable from someone who can’t speak English at all.
It's not racial, you idiot, and a false assumption of this is why Valve is reluctant to deal with the issue to begin with. [Non-retarded SA players hate the rat kids more than anyone else.](https://www.dotafire.com/dota-2/guide/honest-goos-guide-to-per-with-slang-dictionary-22001)\n\nBesides, most of the racism I see in matches comes from these people... ironically, most often directed at one another.
True, but you don't lose cosmetic, maybe you just can't queue for 6 month, so you just play on other acc, or transfer item's to that acc.   \n  \nAnyway my point is, toxic guys will be toxic and they will find a way to do it. But i hope this system will fix majority of those problems.
use your friends?
lost 600 mmr in one month from people straightup giving up selling items or feeding down lanes 4.5k~ use and w
Here we go again...
Swooty
This is an issue even at 5.6k+ where I'm playing, and yes, at that rank my team does owe me basic communication in the language of the region. You don't like that don't play a team game at high level.\nI'm not sure you understand the frustration of playing at what's supposed to be high-end dota (leaderboards or divine 4), and still getting carries shouting cyka blyat in eu west.
NSFW?
Yep must be those game ruiners amirite. It couldn't possibly be because of you since you played almost perfectly each game no no must be those stupid game ruinerrss BrokeBack. When I win, it couldn't possible be because I got carried. I played 1v9 each game!!!1!!11!! (Until the feeders arrived ofcourse)\n\nTake control and change what you can change. Don't be a coward and just blame the feeders. 600 mmr lost because of game ruiners? Lmao gtfo and git gud. Post the matches where you lost 600 mmr because of feeders/ruiners and i'll wait.
Nice valve .Shit player like ccnc that always silence in  game not getting it with his bad gameplay while his random solo teammate try hard or good play trying to win and talking shit about him in game..nicaaa.fucking fail mid. Watch all hghhhis recent match. Action speak louder than word. No doubt european always better in anyway real life or gaming. Fucking american. I am not even european just third world that you don't even bother.
Nothing is full proof\n
I hate CS stealers almost as much as I hate feeders, so I'm not sure how to feel about this.
I've lost 30 out of my last 35 matches and effectively every game has had 1, likely 2, ruiners on my team (EUW, Neutral behaviour score card). Sometimes you just get really bad luck in the people you queue into, and obviously it's harder to play well with those people on your team, and it makes not tilting impossible. You should understand that in a community of 12 million or so people, some are just going to have very shitty luck.
16 years old CCnC typed 6 words in twitch, let's make a thread about it, 2cringy4me redditor btw.
\nTRIGGERED.
What's wrong with flaming

I swear it's like a staple of american culture to blame all their problems on other races/languages/whatever. Like if valve just banned all peruvians from US servers they wouldn't improve, because they'd just find a new scapegoat. NA players just can't handle that the problem with their games is themselves as individuals. From what I've seen of streams for all the regions, NA definitely has the most toxic and irresolute region culture of all.\n\n^^^^^american ^^^^^downvotes ^^^^^incoming ^^^^^woo
It's not weird. Valve secretly added a region-grouping function. Basically you get grouped with people near and around you. So those 5 Peruvians got into 1 team because they are, incidentally, all playing from Peru(Or its neighboring ($hithole)countries)). Same thing with me and a LOT of other true NA players.
Nice troll bro, made me laugh, upvoted.
Repost
2 scenarios for me personally.  \n\n1:  You play like shit, you man up and apologize for playing like shit, I'll probably mute you, but that's it unless you're doing stupid shit that the team is telling you not to.\n\n2:  You play like shit and flame the team, continually arguing it's not your fault...then you get reported.\n\nSimple as that for me.  I'll be the first to apologize for a bad game, so it really pisses me off when I'm solo carrying a team and the feeder says "ez game...commend me".  
Op said the extras in the middle. I'm supposing you don't lose any tango, just the ones you put extra 
Up to you, keep watching him. 
Up to you. Keep watching him
.... Which means you lose tangos.
and it is unusable... meaning you lose it. Its a glitch.
for other regions, its fine but in SEA where most players are toxic and fucking cancerous this will not work unless you always play in midnight. you play with kids every single day and they always act like some bigshot when trying to pick post1/post2 right of the bat.
Then dont watch.
I've been playing this game for 6000 hours and still suck with storm despite sporting a 60% winrate with a hero like arc warden
Good, this game needs less particle effects.
I dunno but sometimes I feel like I win and lose in streaks always. Like I can play 10 games where I feel I played great and lose all of them. And I could play 5 games in a row and feel like I got carried for those 5 games. 
Can't lose the 6th tango if you never had it.
f u
Funniest post in a while in here. Upboated
Good riddance 
Here's an idea to piss everyone off!\n\nYou can remove your ban, and reset your Behavior score for 10$\n\nConsidering how money-grubbing Valve has become, i believe this could happen.\n\nWould piss off us players, but people would still pay to get unbanned, and Valve finds new ways to cash-in from some poor idiot's addiction.
STFU shitstain
*is supposed to

Cya retard.
Sharing is caring...
Ok,played 1 game; i return my words back,dota 2 became better with new update,sry guys
This is definitely not the best game you dumbass, a best game consists of two top tier team with lots of back and forth action going on. This game is just Kinguin playing bad and Mineski playing like Gods.
I did it before. Radiance scepter dagon 5 refresher octarine boots. Much stronger than right click jugg. Problem is getting there because theres like a 15min window where you dong get any stronger while you're farming octarine and upgrading dagon
well best is subjective u fucking cockwomble
How to ruin a game: put Lumi on it. 
he's faceroll cancer, wins his lane easily, scales amazing at all points in the game. The people who lose on him can't micro his ward properly.
Its only subjective if you imply it. 
All are percent to proc... It was a very linear thought process given he was replying to the viewers. Seems like you are the one spacing out. Lol
The true WTF is his its it's usage. 
You have issues, seek help.
What a shitpost 
I have a great idea for juggernaut nerf. Limit the number of omnislashes on a target to 3 or 4 while increasing the jump distance so more heroes are likely to be targeted. This is similar to the number of Lucent beams limit per target for Luna's ultimate. \n\nThis change doesn't drastically Nerf Juggernaut's team fight potential but does reduce his solo killing capability. 
think it was team DK vs LGD lower bracket at TI4 game 1
Adblock sells what it considers "Acceptable advertisment" the ability to bypass it

You fuckers are so fucking sad.
Most trolls are depressed sociopaths who have self esteem issues. You seem to be one, damn this new ban system is amazing. Hopefully lifetime bans are next for people like you. Being an asshole/ troll has nothing to do with a flawed report system, it has everything to do with your flawed personality though. Good riddance, I hope more of your kind follow, truly. 
+1 that fucking lumi said after megas "it was the worst OD game" lol. worst caster IMHO. 
Nicea idea, though I think it should pop more to draw the eye. 
Imo EG was more hype, becasue of the "Eblade, Soul Catcher, Dagon fom 100% to 0 in 0.5 sec" kills.     \nBut this game was #2 for sure.
Can you just not come back? 
Get wrecked
OP sounds like the kind of guy to falsely report people. \n\nBut this is what the community has become a bunch of whiny 12 year olds who circle jerk each other. 
Adblock, boooh!
&gt;Much stronger than right click jugg\n\nYou know your 2k games don't matter for what's strong or not, right? 
For what do you need it during a game? You have clear notification about recent changes during picking phase and in the ability tooltip there should be only current skill details displayed
Git gud (as a person)
?
I will tell you right now, **if they change it to 3 seconds earlier, I will alt tab for these 3 seconds, forget about the game, get abandon, repeat it 10 times, and end up banned for 6 months**, games are already bad and my attention span for afk farming while alt tabbed untill rest of the players finish doing what pub people do - not playing dota - is too short to allow any breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nI get that some people need time to reorient, but I don't, game's ez, it's forcing yourself to pay attention to it despite how ez it is that's real challenge.\n\n\n\nJust saying, and I can feel downvotes, I like it how it is and wouldn't like it changed, but I understand why you'd like it different.
the fuck
i hate him too lol
Cancer. 
Download more RAM for your brain
You are probably that way. That was way too specific.
Depends on the style of cast, I guess. For a hypecast you're right.\n\nPersonally I prefer it when players cast and give their view (it's educational), and they'll call GG when they see it.
Bullshit. 
#don't make stupid person famous
If you are not paying attention to glowing ! mark in picking phase you really will pay attention to skill tooltip?
Also broke your english, it seems.
but it's only ~~january~~ february..
Hey, i am not complaining, didn't make thread about it, it doesn't make me angry or affect my gameplay. I am just asking a question, not asking to remove it. I didn't know it is implemented, thought this is an idea for new change
lmao trying to make this into a race issue hahahahhaha\n\nu are such a sad pathetic worm
Yes yes yes
Yeah, otherwise people won't even see there was a change. It looks like just another line of the description.
I don't what made this Kinguin-Mski more spectacular to you. I mean you admit that the quality of EG-Ehome was much much higher and yet you think it is less spectacular? 
Okay, I will go old naggy granny on your asses, but can we stop this? Devs press these links thinknig it's a real fucking issue. And it's turns out it was really nothing

I mean... This game went right down to the wire, it's kinda pointless to draw conclusions from this game\n\nLumi's still a bit clueless as the "analyst" caster, but this game could've easily went either way.
LUL full circle

Go fck yourself and never come back. 
fuck the plebs
well you are a cancer and thanks valve to fuck you in the mouth.

If it's paused mid action you shouldn't be alt tabbed to begin with.
ESSL is run by nazis, why watch their tournament?
Liquid lost to this LUL
I missed g1 jeez what happened
siren is balanced what is not balanced is teamfighters like od tide .these heroes become monster paired with naga
really strong for coordinated teams. not so much for everyone else. Teams that use her are usually so in-sync
Moon definitely best mirana in the world
Na'Vi &gt; Mineski &gt; Newbee &gt; Liquid ^^^^no ^^^^Kappa
Mushi is on rape mode today
Isn't that buff because you have more fps now ?
Apparently not anymore.
pls remove average gpm too, i mainly play support but my teammates won't let me play carry even when i had the highest rank BibleThump
need that wallpaper name ... :D
serious enough to shitpost.
What set is that?
Never as good as having time to go over everything in fine detail. Plan our next assault. Do the math on the damage we can do, choreograph how to min max everything to escape.  Not everyone is TI standard and can calculate everything in the fly but some of us do try.
Not sure why this is upvoted.. playing with trash heads like this that join a game just to troll just ruins 9 other peoples time. Although he at least admits that he's been in LP for the last 6 months but still..
still nobody is a pathetic a caster as sunsfan. Gay and dick jokes left and right. Shits literally unwatchable anytime hes casting, doesnt matter whos playing.
thank you :D
He's the twitch of Dota 2 now xD
agree don't care about all hero challenge also most successful heroes it list ursa.....I don't even remember when i played ursa
CoolFrog ????? ??? CoolFrog ????? ??? CoolFrog ????? ??? CoolFrog ????? ??? CoolFrog ????? ??? CoolFrog ????? ??? 
But then it last 60 seconds.
why would they have to? does the game tooltip explain what cast range is? or what is pure damage?

What's with Mineski and giving offlaners a hard time lmao
IMO picking techies in ranked should be considered trolling. You're putting your team in a different position then they are used to, and making any non defensive play a 4vs5 all for your selfish reasons.\n\nIt's different then picking something off meta because even if you go lich carry you can still team fight.
thank god no sheever &amp; lumi. trent and maut can be just muted
Ah he was referring to a personal computer? Like a phone.\n\nToday's lesson has been entitled "words fucking matter", you are welcome. 
What? Cant help yourself into clicking the other thread? 
china fans lmao
ŁÓŁ
Can't you explain instead of write useless shit?
fuck off
Seams like you didn't learn much from the lesson, but the main focus was "words fucking matter". Any more questions?
For me, cast point is also deductible. What is your point?
You actually seem proud of it. Fucking idiot
LồL
He's really nothing without him imo. His ults are super fast. I don't remember seeing him shine with another hero like that sadly.
First time I've been able to watch this tournament and I'm noticing that once again there's the networth bar right behind the players. Not sure if it was the last StarLadder that also had that.\n\nThat seems like they're giving away information the players shouldn't have no? I mean I understand pro players typically have a better feel for how they're doing net worth wise relatively but I still find it strange.
3 attempts lul 
ceterum censeo carthaginem esse delendam
It's based on winrate so if you played him once and won then he should be there.
Why do you need info on cast point? Unless you are a pro player, analyst or a coach, that info does not matter to you at all, because nobody cares about knowing the cast point in pubs.
who would care about cosmetics when they are smurfing?
&gt;Ask for any info you want.\n\nsorry, you didn't seem to read my comment
Should display Luna in your profile, way better rack with the right item
Aaaand thats why you are 2k
Op are u a girl? That means u are so kinky and lesbo ?
Then just stop watching his patch videos?
A lot of internet people don't know that. It's the consumer reflex.
If that till help, and I fully understood the exact context, maybe I wouldn't have asked the question in the first place..?
Why is pyrion on the  desk anyway? lends nothing to the discussion and not even fun to watch
Man am I really tired or are Sheever,Pixel and Pyrion really stressful to listen 
Why do you still have jungle builds seriously.
hire.jayjay.u.fucks.
Seriously? You're telling me you know and remember the cast point of every single ability you love to use and you take into account that while in the heat of the battle?
Okay.
Because he has no game knowledge, most of the builds are really bad. My newbie friend tried his builds on 2-3 heroes and was shocked how horrible they were.
no way mineski can deal with tiny+dusa
I think they do not want a caster who is part of a dota2 team(eg)
I hate the new UI.  Haven't been able to find a background out of my loading screens that actually made sense having.   This... This is different.    Off to check if I have this one.
CuckActionSlacks
It's the *point* at which the spell is *cast*
Cast point is very explicitly in depth mechanism that most casual do not care about. You might, but i dont think people like you are a majority.
yep\nyou right
nah just hate when people hate on the good casters. Lumi is a great knowledgeable caster, sunsfan is the fat retard you hire when you dont have enough money to buy a proper caster. Try and ban me doesnt really matter plenty of ways around it.
The patch is the context, like whatever dude, dont know why I got downvoted, I thought its enough of an explanation, its not even rocket science smh
Mushi chrono on point this game.
is this sarcasm or not?, i am confused. haha
He's bad for casting but good for twitch chat = more viewers. Mautism LUL
i'll stalk you until you'll take a picture with me, btw
4 ultis easy medusa
Newbee is not looking like the same team that dominated last week.
Once again maut and purge casting, just why.
Run Void Run!! lmao
I can confirm with single CALCULUS.
They made deals with ad companies to not block their ads.\n\nIt is very badly optimized and makes your browser slow.\n\nThose two are the main reasons people switch to uBlock origin. 
It really looks like newbee is not the same team, if you take naga and disruptor away from them. Even if they win this, some really shaky games from them
Last 2 games the 4th/5th ban always Medusa but this game Mineski changed to Enigma and Newbee picked that snake head right away. Small mistake costs them the game
gg aegis...feelsbadman
i never watched him lol. \n\npurge fanbois are truly 12 year olds.
oh, then where is slacks then? much better than this guy imo\n
Just a sarcasm bro 
This sub loves iceiceice because of his joking nature, but if anyone has been the weak spot in Mineski, its most certainly him.\n
Dude lumi is awesome.
Man, you are arguing with me for your viewpoint. I am saying most people don't look or care about cast point. Its a much advanced mechanism of the game, than cast range.
The RPs were mostly set up by Naga sleep.\n\nWhat's your point?
A week from now when you're playing the hero for the 10th time you'll be happy it doesn't stand out 
not attacking or defending anyone. Just bringing to light theres plenty of more shit casters than Lumi. Lumi has casted multiple TI's. Your opinions on his casts are irrelevant. Way to join in on the conversation with a useless comment. Please continue
When I did say how it should be? I asked why and wrote about other ways you can see it. There are many things not mentioned in tooltip (example: to know that familiars grant visage aura you need to visit dota wiki and many others) so again, why the information that is no longer valid should be instead?
&gt;Maut\n\nwhen will they learn... when..\n\nAlso 2non stop ranters, one being Sunsfan memeing or talking cosmetics/lore 80% of the time and the other being Purgerino with his 5k "pro" knowladge criticizing every item build or play only to eat his words 5mins later
Reddit Analysis BrokeBack 
You are an idiot. Your argument is based on assumption that I am arguing that knowledge of cast point is worthless. I am not saying that. I am saying showing the cast point in miliseconds is worthless because nobody is counting that during the fight. You just get accustomed to the cast point as you play the game. You are not going to count 0.3 seconds after you press the spell button. Because you can't. You just have to get used to the way delay works in the game.\n\nMy point is that even if that cast point is displayed in tooltip, it won't matter because a lot of the players don't know the word. They know from experience that spells take different time to cast on different heroes, but they don't know its called cast point. It is simply worthless information for normal crowd.
fuckin snake woman. \n\nfeels so bad seeing Mineski won teamfight but Medusa kept leading net worth for miles
Mautism BrokeBack LUL
Are you okay?
What a bunch of idiots in these subreddit lmaoz
wow, your a piece of shit

Not really a bug, but switching through profile tabs has a really annoying animation. 
The logical explanation for that would be new patch, new ui, new profile so reset the graph
I'l never roll for a role. I played A LOT with people who just straight up point on that minimap where they want to go. First came first served. But i won't let some retarded RNG that i never had luck with to decide who's going mid/carry
*retarded RNG\n\n"never had any luck with"\n\nThinks people playing mid or carry impact game more than other roles\n\nyea no conclusions to draw from that
"Its only retarded if it doesn't work on me"
Well i don't want RNG to decide who plays what role. \n\nI never had any luck in my life with RNG stuff why should i start now ?\n\nThis doesn't mean anything
Is retarded because is RNG. Every RNG stuff is retarded. I don't like RNG so in my opinion RNG is retarded. People can't have an opinion ? \n\nOnly in this subreddit you can get downvoted because of your own opinion. NICE
This right here is why I uninstalled dota
Can you hear people talking on mic like this?
Because people don't roll for a role ?
DID YOU JUST ASSUMED HIS/HER/ITS GENDER??!!
The fact that you can't even see why people are calling you out makes this even funnier.\n\nDunning Kruger is real. 
Please tell me. Because it seems like i'm retarded.
I have a pretty bad computer. Also from what i know, that screen works the same for everyone if you don't alt tab before him. \n\nBut sure, i can get hated on this and downvoted to hell,  but there's literally no official rule with who goes where, and you don't like who point mid, i don't like the RNG from a roll. \n\nSeems like there's no middle option.
Hocamin has some pretty good hints to help ya out bud
Yea and even if you ROLL the guy who lose the roll can still go that roll. So i prefer sticking with who points the minimap. \n\nAt the end of the day is just a game, and there's no rules either for a team composition. If i can have fun playing the game, and at least try to do something, i'm ok with having 5 people on the mid lane.
This is how a bussiness starts
I don't know how letting the RNG to decide is fair, but OK. I'm not saying that who point first is 100% fair or whatever, but yea, in the end there's no FAIR way to decide.\n\nBut in my experience with RNG i never had any luck, so in no way i'm gonna start use it now.
hey, thats me\n
r/therewasanattempt to cheat \n\nEdit: stupid autocorrect

So its the players who left? And I thought the new pro circuit system will bring out new stable orgs. \n\n
Not surprising. That squad wasn't very good. Perhaps they might find better luck going to SA Dota.
Whats the odd....
Could have just done /roll 100-100 ?
ew.. support omni
I never said they were a good squad. Instead, I said they weren't very good, as I watched a few of their games. Looked like poor communication more than anything.
"smaller wins ty" *picks sven*
Oh lol I meant BSJ and his teammates should try their luck at SA dota not the org.

And this is why NA is such a mess. An arguably top 4 (Probably top 5 when AP kick into drive), just disappears overnight. 
LOL He peaked when he finished #1 in the now non-existent NEL.
Maybe. I mean, players have good streaks and bad streaks too of course. Misery has been around a long long time and finished 2nd at ti6 I think it was? Hasn't had as good of a result since then, but still a solid player. Same with w33 or Madara. Maybe with enough consistency and luck they'll get somewhere.
i mean bulldog and singsing are the same thing\n\ntheir subs are made up of man children, I feel bad for them tbh
Leviathan looked real good there for a min especially when monkeys first joined. BSJ teams always seem to have this point where they start to look good but then something just happens and they lose then do nothing but lose. Maybe it is a mindset thing or BSJ isn't real proficient on a diverse amount of heroes. I would like to see him cast though if he stops playing!
lmao ikr. these bsj fangays dont realize theres a reason hes never made a LAN. hes a shit carry player by pro player standards. its simple as that. theres so many games he just has little or no impact. 
you would have to be socially inept to see that singsing either\n\n1. puts on a act on stream so his 16 year old fanbase will watch him\n\n2.is actually an adult who acts like a 16 year old, and if that's the case it's nothing to be proud of
You just have to watch this episode of Tobiwans new show to realise it's all an act.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDdRhcqzdh8

Vegans - Worst kind of guests you can invite because:\n\nA. You have to go through all the trouble of creating something specifically for them (vegan products are definitely more freaking expensive than normal everyday ones) or else they'll be screaming at you IRL about how inconsiderate you are and then proceed to shaming you on social media on their vegan groups (basically witch hunting)\nB. Open up a topic regarding meat/animal products and they'll yap your ear off explaining things and trying to convince you to go vegan as well and if you don't listen, will proceed to shaming you on social media claiming you're a narrowminded brute (basically a flat earther)\nC. You have to be very careful on what you post on social media because the moment they something they think is offensive for them, they'll bombard your post with comments against you, take a screenshot of your post and proceed to shame you on social media (basically feminist)\n\nSo yep. Most vegans (at least the ones I know and definitely stay away from) are high maintenance combination of witch hunter+flat eather+feminist behavior.
what the fuck did i just watch LMAO
plus half of the things labeled "vegan" are just lying shits, so you either have 1)the hypocrites who just see the vegan labels...\n\nor you have the fanatics who will absolutely demolish you because you bought the wrong brand of "vegan"

This happened because VGJ didn't give enough space to BSJ to farm. They should just all pick support and let BSJ carry the game. It's pretty sad when a player like BSJ can't find teammates of his level. 
funny joke!!!!!!!!
We will never know what he's capable of doing because he will never leave his brother
Even if ritsu was better than fear it'd be a horrible idea. He definitely has a negative impact on his teammates.

This clip just shows him last hitting after a fight with miranas starfall... that being said this clip doesnt do him justice, his a fantastic player in the last few years. I'd love to see him in O.G or another big organization he'd be up there with g.h if not better. I get why he won't leave his brother and i respect it, loyalty is rare. But when it comes to literally millions of dollars on the line id probably fuck that off, he's a better man then me.

I'm pretty sure there's a way that you can keep omni slash on a single target, I've definitely seen this before from another pro player, Illidan, I think, the clicking patterns definitely can help sort of aim omnislash, but I think there's still luck involved.\n

I know it looks so amazing to you, see my above comment
You're welcome, dickhead.
Same with slark.\n2 Immortals use the same slot, which is bullshit.

This reddit acct I will keep private for unrelated reasons, but I go between 5k-6k and it's just my opinion if you think this play is especially exceptional you probably are not a very talented player. 
I say i commend but I don't because fuck them 
As the plot thickens.... 
They split up for quite a while though
So anyone who plays PA or Riki are league players? Makes sense to me.
Nothing of value was lost for the dota community.
I believe they simply make the lobby themselves so they can't get kicked because they are head of the lobby.
Please no. Not back to watching artstyle feed continuously down offlane.
Jabz is fuckin thrash at drafting, Winter is probably too soft as a coach thats why they are always getting outdrafted prior to this tournament.
get rekt
Casters not understanding this is actually Mineski slowly getting into the winning position.
Well if you played decent calls and friendly, you'll get commends without asking. My first game was as nightstalker creating space for feeders mid and carry, and finally won after 55 min, insta commends 
Scratch that, Mushi's build is 0 dps.
i got 1700 games and 160 commends. not a lot but i usually talk a bit on voice chat and tell pelple well played or not to give up when they are tilting.
enigma with dem fine thigh gap
I get commends in roughly 50% of my games (I'm sure not exactly due to probably getting multiple in one game with 0 in more) , I just try to balance my team with my hero selection and try not to be toxic to the team in anyway.
Wtf is this Empire doing, dancing around the map. They have summons, they have Lycan and BM, they have the AC, Aegis and Cheese and the dusa still doesn't have dps - this is the worst shit I've seen. Zzz

My God, Empire is horrendous - and I was defending them before this game. My mistake.
:D:D:D:D
Throwpire.\n\nWell it's counter-thrown LUL this game is so sloppy.
Mushi makes medusa look like shit lmfao
This is the worst game of Dota in a long time.
Key in Mineski getting ahead in teamfight is picking off 1 support or disable from Empire, clearly their Ego were too much for this game as they spiraled to their loss.
OD stating that "Empire can't win this" - "I don't know how Empire can win this game", maybe don't make absolute statements with 3k game knowledge? 
They wanted to play worse than Empire, and that was the only way to do it.
Medusa pushes high ground while half of the team pursues a far away Kunkka NotLikeThis
True. Most hype casters have a ‘severe’ lack of understanding of game. It concerns me actually.
Blitz sounds pretty drunk monkaS.
Blitz confirmed opium abuser.
dark seer in 2018 LUL reflection is better than wall of replica now wish icefrog buff it
Yeah that was so bad. Like from 3-4k pub.
Empire had a shitload of control, two sets of Necro creeps for mana burn and the casters still expected dusa to carry this game on her back. Dusa with no damage mind you.
E what drawing? cmonBruh
Not to hate, but are you boosting/smurfing on that acc? I owned every single game on a 300 MMR acc yet I only had about 12 commends in the conduct summary.
4.6k now I think. A little bit hypocritical of me, true, but 5,000 games and that's pretty eh, especially in a region where MMR climbing is easier + he has access to higher skilled players to learn from.
He's either very tired or drunk cause his speech is in the "yeaaaaaaahhh" mode.

You're not a 4k player. How is this hard for you to grasp? The real world doesn't allow boosting and you will always be a loser unless you actually try to improve. \n\nAll you'll do is ruin 4k games 
Why only 6 months ban from buying an account?

Probably not going to be too popular to say this. \n\nBut does she really need bootslot? \n\nIn these you do "cheat" to make the issue bigger. Do remember that seeing a hero from the front at same height isn't the way we see it while playing
SO FUNNY XD HE GAVE HIS TANGOES XDDDD\n\nThe amount of singsing fangays in this leddit is too high.

I've been reporting boosted/booster accounts in the past month after having sufficient evidence. I hope they all get banned. 
LMAO 
I am so tired of seeing people post their life stories of them being shitty toxic people on this Reddit to farm karma. Nobody cares. Go away.

no they dont
Thanks mi lord!
This is good. Instead of Fuckingbad who writes garbage and bullshit like "You should buy Daedalus because it gives damage" and gets praised, people like you should have written those tip things.\n\nThanks salt lord.
xDDDDDDD take my upvotes 
I agree that more parts of many heroes should be made fully customizable, but I'm kinda glad the first two sets aren't in the game. They don't match with the hero's colour scheme, so in these cases I'd say the boots aren't the biggest problem.
Wish there was a deeper discussion of the starting item choices. 
I really liked his scream hypes when casting with LD, since he's the guy that can actually juggle the chemistry together. They both seemed like they are having fun though.
Mineski beat Liquid in the past few months IIRC, I think it's possible, also Mineski seems in good form atm.
Can someone give me an explanation of why Lumi is trash and gets hated? Just to know because I don't see him much.
isn't this they guy who called us out ? \nnow when he needs views for his shitty youtube channel comes to reddit Hmmmmm
He gets so over hype..like holy shit
Stick to solitaire
Personally I don't like how 99% of casters in Dota sound like they are speaking into a muffled mic.
you got downvoted for asking legit question, i just don't understand this subreddit anymore
27 minute video on support starting items WutFace. 
i mean theres 5k "support mains" who dont buy chicken \n\none day I qued some great ranked matchmaking and the cm who said "im playing 5" didnt buy chicken and I already bought my boots on the nightstalker 4 that I picked\n\nsome people are bad wat can u do
Still lost lul
Still throw fyi...
But if lumi didnt have that kind of attitude to disturb other caster we will never hear "....five hero death chuan chuan is survived chuan is gonna go down puppey talked about the naga counter its light of heaven with his bkb" \n
You could say the exact same for Xyclopz but reddit jerks off over him.
And they said on the panel that he considers himself bad at Earth Spirit!
You should've went to that channel and disliked all of the videos. As long as you don't stay long enough, the view won't be monetized.
Why am I laughing at this...
I like Lumi ??‍♀️

how he can reach 5k baffles me
you'd be surprised, theres a lot of bad players at 5k\n\nhero spamming inflates mmr by a good amount\n\n5k isnt anywhere near as good as it used to be also, so there's that too\n
Same.\n\nHow many fucking games did he play to go from "F to normal"?\n\nEvery 2nd idiot on the sub has been karmawhore posting about sucking up to the 6-month ban system since 7.08 with no confirmationing info. 
Unfortunately it doesn't matter how cute your early game is if you can't close out games. TL outplayed the shit out of them.
which page? the "not winning again" page?\nnaah just kidding. Mineski fought well, can't discredit them.
Not hard to know drafts at this point, when the pool is down to about 20 heroes (being hyperbolic, but the pro meta sure seems stagnant). I'll be interested to see the post tourney stats. 
FTFY*  Trump.
It was his call only, its not like Kuroky dictates every decision they make.
I like lumi but I respect everyone's opinions about him. Downvote me for the sake of it.
who gives a fuckg about downvotes anyway lol
You know that now both teams start with the chicken automatically now right?
Lumi should learn English before he casts. Now before you are saying: He actually speaks English, no he doesn't. 
and when liquid is still unconscious  and still not over about the party with their aegis.
BLASPHEMY! THATS NOT MY FLAIR
oh fucking hell, i even read that in his voice.  God damn never thought I'd see a transcript so bad that Trump seems literate!  Oh wait, that's every cast by Lumi.  Dude can't speak English, Can't analyze dota because he doesn't play it, and yet somehow cast half the TI matches with reddit hate threads every day.
Username doesn't check out. I brought you one bruh, "ASSFAGGOTS".
SICK
I guess you can put it like that as well. 
in other news,ShitShit is still a tool
It started out as a FifthEE/FifthEE...................\n\n\n
Unpopular opinion here but I don't mind Lumi. Sure, he's not my favourite caster but he's knowledgeable, he's passionate about the games and I enjoy the way he speaks his mind, especially when he's on the panel.
Is jebaited even a word in English ?
Flax is also terrible as usual. He literally contributes nothing to the panel, I have no idea why someone would see this guy as useful. It's literally as if they picked a random 3k player, except sometimes trying to fit a dad joke in his "insights" on the panel.
Why can't you just appreciate the lesson for what it is? Two brothers, really skilled at dota, wanting to share some knowledge.\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with the 6 months ban. It's possible PPD might be trying to salvage his reputation from the twitter fiasco a couple weeks ago. Never seen someone's reputation in this subreddit drop faster.
hi guys,this is valve,we like to deepthroat monkey shit because we are lazy useless fucks

I've tried playing on that and let's just say it was... less than helpful.   
whats the racist youtube video?

Flag the video as inappropriate.
Spoiler/NSFW
well this is much more sneaky. Skewer him into 4 heroes. wow
I'd rather lumi solo casted because lyrical is not my cup of tea either.
I was outside with a lot of sunshine when watching this clip so I couldn't identify all of Mineski's lineup, and for the first three or four replays I thought they had an LC, the crowd did a pretty good Overwhelming Odds cheer

Fogged makes a ton of mistakes, please, he isn't any good either. I understand why people want to get on the Lumi hate-train, that doesn't mean fogged is a good analyst, neither is lumi
Dunnow man. They lost to Na'vi at Genting. They have consistently been falling short on LAN. Their team is great, massive skill, insane teamplay...but the results are just not there. After their insane start to the season, they have really fallen off.\n\nI hope they do better, time for Mushi to give SEA that TI win!
Huwats the matter?
because seagal didn't have big roles and it's a martial artist master
Defender of her people. I thought it was a she
There should definitely a nerf to force staff.  \nProbably cannot use it to same target after 3 seconds? \nIts so hard to fight as melee heroes with multiple force staff.
Dont you fucking insult our egg. He might play like a shitter but he understands the game and can audibly convey what he thinks. 
 nice man that will help, or instead of ranked maybe ranked for solo and P.Ranked for Partys matches
Idea for new item: **Instead of stunning target, the item X+Y+Z roots them and glues you to them; No matter how forcestaffed they are you'll follow them in melee-range**. Extremely good if done right, certain suicide if done wrong, would make a lot of heroes that are just kite-fest and boring as fuck to play more viable for actual combat/fighting/fun.\n\nYeah I love my 60+ naga+alch+pa etc. like anyone, but when countered with kiting etc. a lot of games devolve into farmgames. \n\nWhy not give a possibility for people to drive through it and try to force teamfights?\n\nJust a thought tho
about tree fiddEE I'd say
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand lumi's commentary. his commentary is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of psychological science most of his comments will go over a typical viewer’s head. His interrupting culture as Professor DeLong says: ''The difference between interrupting and non-interrupting cultures is not a simple and arbitrary choice of social norm, but instead reflects a judgment about whose words are likely to be most valuable to hear...'' . The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his interrupting comments, to realise that they’re not just interrupting comments they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike lumi interrupting truly ARE idiots.
&gt; Solo MMR:3139\n&gt; (last update: 2017-08-20)\n\nWhat do you mean he understands the game? He's literally just above average and he's meant to be a fucking analyst. Dude's a content creator and nothing more. Go and watch the panel, he has no idea what to say most of the time, other than some bland jokes.
Sorry i had to do it
What? Objectively Lumi has become better as a caster\n\nThe amount of wrong info he provides has gone down, his phrasings are more accurate and less fiddled by putting a conclusion in the end of a sentence rather than making it first and then defending it after also his voice control has gone from annoying to a bit less annoying\n\nHe still is an ass as a person though, that part hasn't changed
I hate content that is aimed towards people that don't play the game. Out of the 27 minutes there were pretty much just a minute of neat content.
Are you dumb enough to NOT remember when you played X game as solo or party?

Thanks Malaysia!
this is why i hate Chinese teams because their fans act like it's world cup or that a Chinese team losing will bring shame to the whole country, and just go full PJSalt when they lose, it's kinda fun to watch crowd reaction when a Chinese team loses in China lol.
No replays yet?
So is this what it felt like when Navi won every tournament when they were relevant? I think it's kinda boring to know the outcome of tournaments before they end. Kinda like how the patriots are more than likely going to win the Superbowl tonight 
I think Miracle is talked about a lot here on this sub - but I actually think Miracle is the best player right now.
Liquid has high chance of winning when having an IO. Must have had banned the hero in the first place. They didn't learn. Congratulations!
solid tier 1.5* I believe? They aren't that bad are they?
ARTEEZY DOTO BEST DOTO
I worry for Secret. Liquid is unbelievably good. And I think the balance will shift back to them the closer it gets to TI.
Newbee intentionally lose so Liquid dont revenge'd em so quickly.\n\nstill want to enjoy their victory over the curse. kappa
eat shit you stupid fuck
9000 int play
What do the top 3 European teams have in common?\n\nAnswer: they have, as either captain or coach, one of the original members of Natus Vincere.\n\nThe best players change, but the best captains stay the same.
Has Liquid's dominance surpasses that of Alliance's back in 2013?
which past team do you think is better than this iteration of Liquid?
Luck is no excuse my dude. 
Only because they got a bunch of points from Lil\n\nIf they wont step up their game and start winning points for themselves they might fall off and be out of the top 8 by the time TI is around..
African people never discovered wheel or written language on their own.
Aside from kuroky and puppey who's the other one?
Matumba the best lycan player? I beg to differ. \n\nEDIT: Please keep downvoting a different opinion.
Wings. Alliance. 
I couldn't care less about the contents of the video, intentions of the bot holders or whatever.  \n\nI do not negotiate with the terrorists.
oh..of course, i meant to imply that this version of Liquid is the best team the game has seen so far
Are you actual mental or just trippin ?? meele carries have advantage in scaling spells compare to ranged and u want nullify that shit with item.which will make assured kill.it wont happen.if u get kited buy blink sb abyssal.or dont pick wk.
i think it's most likely 1 qualifying slot per region with the other 2 from wildcard
It's so cute, 5 heroes waddling after an earth spirit in one line.... just me? Ok...
Did you even read his lore? 
Thanks, TIL. Now to try and understand the downvotes... :thinking:
Why are you telling me that? 
Egypt was never black, lol. Don't buy in WE WUZ KANGS propaganda
&gt;The best players change but the best captains stay the same.\n\nKuroky wasn't a captain in Navi and Art Style isn't captaining VP so I have no idea what you're talking about. 
Like Tasteless in SC2. His casts were dull since early 2012 
the scene wasn't that competitive back then and i am pretty sure they dominated less patches
Saying Ursa falls off is not bad logic, he does. Against those three heroes most of the time an Ursa will lose the game if it gets to 40+ minutes, not withstanding contextual game elements and the other picks.
Try reading what I quoted again.\n\nNow you perhaps have a slight idea of what I'm talking about. 
Yes, the team that outplayed everybody at TI and were put up arguably the most dominating performance since 2012-2013 Alliance.\n\nThere are multiple criteria for greatness, namely peak vs longevity. 
I like him more than Slacks tbh. Slacks has the tendency to be cocky for having a Divine medal while having bad knowledge about the game. 
sub saharan africans are the black people
https://i.imgur.com/pf7toBp.png
What’s the point of having merit system for TI invite then?
Last year they had 18 slots. They won't go lower than that. They will probably go for 20 slots tbh.
I dont need it, because i wont play support ever again, ahahah.
just bullshit made up  "officially". of course they had to invent the pretext to kick Lil even though ramzes and noone had become equally lackluster. a scapegoat just had to be found
Sucks that he missplayed in the end so gh died. I guess he was too hyped so he just wanted to kill more heroes
This thread is cancer. Lumi has his flaws but he's still an awesome caster so quit hating on him
Maybe his best captains stay the same might mean their leadership/draft skills still remain top notch?
I know but there's this cockiness about Slacks that I dislike. Nevertheless, I'd rather have Slack's humour over grant's so I'm all good.
gege
What I take from this interview is that this guy is full of shit. He says Lil's style does not fit the current meta of pos. 4. 7.XX patch is the one where they won the biggest tournament in the org's history, a Major. Then goes to talk about communication issues and other bullshit, but before all of this they've always talked about how they are really good as a team, and how they all liked each other, so everything around the org atmosphere should be taken as a facade. Funny stuff, but to me, looks like they just kicked the guy they liked the least. And Lil doesn't need someone to tell him that Noone and Ramzes are the guys behind the kick, since those two have criticized him publicly on stream. And I'm sure we won't find out the truth, since looking at how they did their contracts, looks to me that nobody can voice any different opinion than what the org stands for.
So the new thing now is trading players for DPC? Pretty sure Lil got a sweet paycheck for that points for Navi
Then you lost both your bets.
fuck off man
Yeah i understand he responded to other guy's comment. But i just wanted to say that 'achievements' are not just stats, building a top tier team from scratch, again and again repeatedly, has to be worth something :)
it was VP that kicked him you retard
I think towards the end of the season when the top 4 are "safe" they wont be participating in the last few minors/majors, since they are close to TI and dont wanna show any strats before the big tournament
Proof?
no
Skeleton king was changed since they couldn't display skeletons in China, right? As I guess he isn't allowed to summon skeletons there then either, what does he summon there?
But still pretty sure Lil got money to make him join Navi . \n\nI mean where the hell is Navi on this Lans?\n\nNavi didn't do anything on Lans except losing and still got #5 on the list that's 900 points vs Sonnieko's 105 and they still got 1 spot  left Navi will find someone without a team with a high DCP for them to join.
I’m really talking about the visual tho... I’m not criticizing the play....
Just block it. This bot is damn annoying.
Whats up salty NA fangay? Wish your boy Artour and Sumail did better? LUL
His voice triggers me. I had to delete his announcer pack. 
VP GM is piece of shit.
True sight was correct. VP guys are shit people
If Lil loses money, Valve should step in and strip all of VP of DPC points, if Noone and ramzes can bitch on stream then Lil can do whatever the heck he likes. I don't like Lil but VP's manager is a bitch,  showed it in the way they handled the Summit invites situation.
rofl,so every trashtalks and flames on Noone &amp; Ramzes streams were just some high quality jokes ? This VP manager is a massive dickhead and he proved it multiple times. This interview shows how this guy is like a russian version of /u/flyingdj. Lil got kicked because they (VP) needed a scapegoat to answer to investors. He talked about how bad Lil is in communicate,teamwork and invidual skills like VP didnt win anything since the start of the season LUL\n\nFamily environment my ass. You can find the true friendly organization in Navi,LiL :)
Reminds me too much of that karl pilkington guy who I also think is an idiot.
No Valve should absolutely not step in, this is some childish revenge shit. Valve isn't a fucking parent and shouldn't act like one, if Lil signed a contract stating he can't talk badly about his team/former team or get fined for it then that's on Lil if he decides to carry on doing it. Weather VP treated Lil badly or not, that's a better question.
This is probably the dumbest comment I've seen.
Lumi is awesome, Redditurds get fucked
&gt; Why is RodjER so good? \n\nwell if rodjer is not good you would not buy him, hypocrits ass\n\n&gt; I would not say unequivocally that VP wanted to get RodjER. We respect the contracts of other players with their organizations, so it's difficult for me to say what made Zhenya Zolotaryova think that we have long been eyeing RodjER.\n\nas GM of VP said contract of player can not be cancel as soon as possible, thought they must talk to rodjer first before kick lil, so it might be not just 1 month plan... IMO they a litle bit aiming rodjer from the dreamleague when navi finished above vp with wonderfull of rodjer action ( as CEO navi said rodjer pretty close to VP member since dreamleague)\n\n&gt; How did it happen that now Ilya is considered a player of Na'Vi, but his contract with Virtus.pro has not expired? \n\nget rid of the contract asshole, you kick, mock him, but just want protect yourself not player
This just illustrates the type of shit character this guy is, and maybe the organisation.
Still better than Lumi
Would be nice to hear an interview with Solo tbh, I don't believe any of this shit.
I don't think Na'vi's manager said that VP wanted Rodjer. He said, iirc, that Rodjer wanted to play for VP because he was better friends with the players there. This just looks like VP's manager trying to twist some words and keep the team away from any blame.
So basically Lil lied his ass off LUL
AdmiralBulldog would like to have a word with you. But you have a fair point, that rarely happens, but LiL had plenty of time to improve but he did not.
both rodger and lil are top tier players, both capable of playing on either team.\n\nWhat happens is a player like lil makes a mistake that is very obvious, even though he may still be an amazing player, that one mistake allowed the rest of the team to start scapegoating their losses onto him and paying hyperclose attention to everything he does which then makes it seem like he is playing even worse, when in reality they are all making just as many if not more mistakes than him.\n\nThe only cure to this is to swap players, both of those players need a break from their team and both of those teams need to start looking inward instead of outward.
Well said.
I think it's stupid to compare gh to lil since 2 teams.play completely different styles,  for example what can Lil do if nonone 2 shots himself against sumails blademail (remember that?)they loose 60+min game after that,  I really think that losses that VP had lately were due to draft or noone underperforming sometimes ramzes, their 3,4,5 positions were always good...
So he just repeats what his manager said, what else did you expect?
I don't really quite understand your post. So if your opinion isn't the same as the general public's one you should stay quiet or you are being "loud"? You can only be honest about something if your opinion is the same as everyone's?
yeah because ive been in the same situation lots of times, I know how bad blood develops overtime and how scapegoating just naturally occurs when things are going bad. It's easier on everyones ego if they can just blame one person for their losses and "reset" with a new player.\n\nbut nmd my "armchair" experience, just look at the dota 2 scene. you see it over and over again, top tier team gets "fed up" with a player they have, kicks him and brings in a new "better" player, and then plays worse. This is pretty much the exact case that happened with secret/eg and arteezy.\n\nteams that shuffle around like this rarely ever play better, you need trust in your teammates to play your best and it's extremely difficult to do that if they just kicked a guy for playing bad and now there is a ton of pressure on you to play better. That's toxic and almost never works.
&gt;lizard people wants to know your location \n\n*block  allow*
What happened? 
Of course I dont know, but I can tell you what it seems to me, that they are trying to justify themselves, reinforce his actions, that tells me of insecurity from VP. I dont see whats up for them by telling it like that, it will be much easier to just state they wanted to improve and that they think Rodger is better than Lil. 
Basically testicular cancer
Yeah there is not much proof about it. But LiL being fined for what he said about VP's players and Solo being paid to say what the org wants are not that separate cases on separate books though
No. Game changes, but not that much. For example, good old 1 button Leoric guide can and will work quite well with armlet. People who are not good enough will win with those guides. \n\nPeople who are good/okay at this game will understand which guide to follow.\n\nedit: how the fuck is this post 3k upvotes... People don't know what guides aim for imo. W/e
he can if he gets hired
I have a 4k friend (Ancient 1 now) who each time he plays a hero he has not played this patch, he asks me how to skill the hero &amp; what items to build. He's stopped soloqueueing now but when he did that and I wasn't there to give him his "guide" he relied on tortedelini's guides. And he's far from alone. I was quite surprised to find that most people (like 95%+) actually do heavily rely on guides in order to know what to build, so much so that many of them don't even know exactly what an item provides. Like they'll know "butterfly gives attackspeed and some evasion", but not how much. Or that "MJ provides lightning proc" etc.
Always someone like you there to tell them they are wrong, right?
Yo Slacks, what's up?\n\nBig fan of your loregasm videos.
Whahahahahaah wtf best comment thread hahahaha
41 in may
It's really really impressive if we consider that at least the last 3 TIs if I'm not mistaken had heroes untouched (and there are many many more matches in a TI).
new patch just hit, even if it wasn't big teams are trying out stuff
But don't forget Ah Fu got spotted by LFY by playing pos 5 :)
fuck off, Yao was the most consistent at the last LGD shamble. And this meta isnt really suitable for Ahfu's 4.
Fuck why Ohaiyo? I'd rather take a fuck ton of Chinese pubstar than him. Now LFY has two passive players in Super and Ohaiyo.
You cannot improve if you consistently follow guides step by step. This doesn’t only apply to older guides, in general, if you buy the same items over and over again you will lose most of your games. If a person wants to reach 4K he must use his brain to figure out the best item choice for each game. Besides, most heroes (invoker, pa, jugg and other simple heroes) use item builds from 2013-2014. So I think Valve has more important things to do right now (like coming up with a battle pass)
He broke up 
Any insta/twitter links ?

What pos?
keep ah fu pos 4 la zzzzzz -,-

lgd.org is building the new dk the next season i think. recruiting the best of sea and the best of cn
Wasn't Victoria playing 4 more often then?
Maybe they are ahead of the meta and know that pos 5 will be the new playmakers. 
ahfu's recent performance on pos 4 is nothing near "godlike", plus with Yao being the pos 4, it's quite possible that they may switch roles. 
No such thing as Chinese language. The two most common dialects are Mandarin and Cantonese.
40 percent of the Malaysian population is Chinese. Large majority of those speak some form of Chinese 
&gt;super\n\nand its over
Yea i dont understand jackshit from this post as well. Inflamed Super Ohaiyo says ah fuck to ying and yao?\n\nhuehue
!remindme 190 days
but why ah fu to 5 instead of yao? 
I did hear an update about something like that a very long time ago. But I don't think I ever tried that yet.  \n  \nBut I'm not really interested in trying him again for a while. I wonder if Vector Targeting makes sense for him to make him easier though.

I don't know man. People judged me the same way you did. I have Tidehunter as my most successful hero, I play him about twice a month, with a win rate of 82% and only 30 games. I play him with confidence and can easily tank and own team fights with him yet people don't believe me until I show them in game.
Not that much? There were new mechanics implemented in the game that guides didn’t have before, or outdated, removed mechanics (talents instead of attributes). Apart from that, yes, the meta changes. __A lot.__\n

idk wtf is redditards defending Yao for, yes he did ply along with xiao8 but FYI, he's the WEAKEST Link even during xiao8 era/team, and u can see how ame treat yao ? i would rather quit the team then teaming with yao shows u how shit is him, apart from 'experience', he's nth, no skill as in compare to legit players, no leadership, no drafting skill, what can he ply ?
lmao shit Ohaiyo shit Super the last two games, and people keep blaming Yao. 
Wasn't the tumor pretty huge though? "pretty good" aren't exactly the words I would use...

I meant we can get that much farm in turbo in short time. Dagons rock in turbo :p
Hell nah, he is by far the hardest spirit to play and all of them aren't easy. The good thing is that you won't screw things up too much if you play bad, but with all the nerfs it is pretty much required to be decent if you wanna win. 
get your facts right, it's 23.4%
I wouldnt call him like that if he didnt act like one. I dont think these heroes u mentioned are as good as his storm, i believe his storm is like top1 in the world. He have other heroes on super high skill also but there are better qop/nyx/shaker/etc players in the world than him. I never said hes 1 hero only player and hes shit on others.
He's 18 fam, you know many 18 year olds not acting like little shits? 
Make sense. Kuro and Xiao8 have already out of fuck to give. ppd and ppy, being a couple of troll they are will just let it be.
ohh nice
that's the usual phrase in case of I AM TOO GOOD FOR YOUR SHIT YAY FAM PLEASE\n\n\nbut what would you expect from lil
He haven't admitted his fault, he stated that he is too open aka "i told the truth because i am an open book" kinda scenario
All you kids saying he shut up because of what Solo said while the VP GM goes around shooting DMCA emails and threatening Lil's family and breaking up his relationships and cursing the future generations of his family.
What do you guys think? 1437 to NAVI? Hahaha I’m just thinking of all the possibilities

well im glad ohy found the team but its huge downgrade tbh

Well a high tier players should know better than using the guide without thinking and to a low tier player the meta changes are less apparent anyway. At low tier the meta I'd also different.
ahh? eg is top tier?

Meta hasn't shifted that much since Liquid won a TI7. their big draft pool helps too but meta is number 1 reason as usual.
you can buy bottle at secret shop?
not drafting pudge when tusk is already taken as 4 because 6 months ban\n\nnot picking any mid, when there is already mid storm... because 6 months ban\n\n\nnot picking (a lot) of junglers because, guess what... 6 months ban\n\n\nand so on.\n\n\nvalve needed to make a real punishment for those scums perutards.

maybe you need to stop assuming the other guy is always a prick.
Always someone like you on reddit who tells someone that the must be stupid because there is never ever someone in a game of dota2 who makes stupid decisions. OP I always wrong. Noone dare saying his irritation is rational.
Dunno, he has arabian name, speaks only arabian, lives in jordan, uses arabian memes
It's a combination of being extremely talented and having a suitable patch and, maybe even more important, not being children. If Liquid was one of those mashup of a team like so many we see, they would have disbanded when they were losing non stop\n\nBesides that, MC and GH are just insanely good and Miracle is probably the best player in the world. It's really an all-star team and Matu brilliantly filling in \n\nI disagree with people saying they have a wide hero pool. For some reason Icefrog decided to not really change the patches drastically for a long time, which is weird, but Liquid very much relies on fluid lanes and I doubt they could beat consistently a splitpush style, a 5-man push style in a favorable patch or a anything more defined. The truth is since before TI7 we are playing the same patch with focus on the 4 position and no actual defined best style, hell, GH is still playing Io and Kotl. He entered the scene playing Io and Kotl, lol\n\n\n\n\n

I like how this last tournament is a reflection of how tourney meta is very far from the pub meta. Tiny is super banned here unlike in pubs he is just unpicked because only a few people know what status resistance is and how good it is and how AM is unpicked(maybe cause he is banned) here but is a must on pubs and all because apparently nobody(at SEA atleast) knows what diffusal is.  
Has to be one to insist on telling others that they are wrong to make them feel bad and oneself feel superior.
I gotta express. Uhmm.. Son? You sound like a virgin manchild. Lol
You know you could have just uploaded some images instead of being a dick.
You started it by claiming the wd was wrong 
One thing: Matu shorts.\n
Gh and miracle are muslims
The biggest factor would be the no-Secret-ness in the tournament. Liquid's winrate drop to below 100% when they face Secret.

Awesome, with this wong he looks like animated stone statue!
Are you kidding me? Sven was very much in the meta when bloodseeker was last popular. The ability to keep a sven/troll/ursa from moving while his bkb is popped so you can kill his team/him after it expires is absolutely insane, especially at pro level play where the team fights are coordinated. And pa and am are not in the meta at all, not to mention he slows down their early game so much and counters them in fact. Your reasoning is complete bullshit
Why are Team Liquid lose to Team Secret?
you are one of the best artists ive seen, i hope someday to be able to draw as good as you 
Defending someone you don't know regarding a situation on the internet you don't know to make yourself feel morally superior.. :V ajajaj

well rip. hopefully he doesnt choke on his first LAN, that being a major on top of it all. dont get me wrong i support them but still... he doesnt seem that "stand-out" player though... right? hopefully they kick ass though
Morally? Lol you're delusional. If you look at the dotabuff his delayed ult is justified because spirit breaker can cancel his ult whenever he wants. Let's not talk about how you picked a techies and want to whine about your teammates poor choices.\n\nThis has nothing to do with morals and everything to do with you being dumb as fuck.

that was against low tier 2 teams in qualifiers. against teams like vega gambit and empire. They had a really hard time against team spirit too...

No, this is what we NEED. What we deserve is an item that is combined from Kaya and Yasha.\n\nIt shall be called Kayasha, or KYS for short.
Solo is like Fear of CIS: I really don't know if there's a player we can respect more.\n\nWell, some people still associate him with 322 incident, but that's not relevant, haters gonna hate.
It is not about the current patch. 
I know Ferrari 430 got to keep his name for years but now that esports is becoming more mainstream I wonder if he will have to change his in-game name.   \n\nI don't know is there a precedent on this /u/esportslaw or can your in-game name be anything that is trademarked.  I know some of the smaller open qualifier teams like Ikea had to change but has there been a case of an in-game name.  \n\nI know one of the Overwatch League players uses Roshan.  I don't know if Valve cares or what is the deal there.\n
Rofl dunno what you're smoking...

What?  Please tell me how to make this bracket "fair" in your eyes?
Spoopy emojis 
fuck you ppd.
So you don't think EG deserves the first seed?
So you don't think EG deserves the first seed?
So if they swap Immortals and one of the teams on EG's side you're ok with it?
That's absolutely delusional.  I like Kyle a lot but it's clear they are not deserving of a higher seed than EG.
So according to you its completely delusional but since you also like Kyle your point is not. Great.\n\nSeeding 1 against 8 is delusional. This bracket stinks.
I actually agree with that, that would make it more fair.  Who's the last team?
Meh whatever, if optic gets to eg's game they'll loose it
Isnt idc yawar mss timado sneyking and svg? They probably arent all that bad, i mean, they probably can take on optic right now. Idk why ppds giving them shit indirectedly
if you based this purely on DPC.\n\nis EG then COL then IMT... the rest has 0, so they are in the same seed position.\n\nwhat make you seed optic over any other NA team, they have 0 DPC points.
IS he still like, the manager of sorts of EG? I heard he took that position but that was about a year ago and I never heard any more details.\n\nJust wondering since his obsession with EG is just... weird.
they qualified to a Minor/Major, I didn't know people could be this dense, heh.
Can he STFU for a month?
Does it matter? EG would smack any of those teams. In all honesty maybe CoL can put up a fight besides that it doesn't really matter. Here is my question will PPD make it to the final? 
Can someone explain this?
did someone really name themself zyzz ? 
qualify does not give you DPC points, you stated you only used DPC points to seed the teams.
PPD is already making excuses even before failing to qualify another tournament. ayy\n\nit's already a rough season for NA dota, probably one of the worst, and but PPD's being ridiculous on social media is quite consistent.
I don't understand why Loda still stick to carry role. He's past his prime like 100 years ago, and i never see him playing ranked. He needs to step back as Pos.5 and let the young talents take core roles.
yeah... you know, Kinguin actually HAS DPC points.\n\nqualifying to a tournament, puts you in the same lvl as SA.
As a bystander, I have to say you're either dense, or pretty stubborn. 
I mean to be fair barely anyone games on apple, and Linux, while really good, is still niche. I expect the number of linux users to spike once Windows 7 leaves extended support, since that was the last good windows OS.
Region lock.
WHY is it so fucking hard to regionlock? Just regionlock the entire of Russia to themselves. Does ANYBODY wanna have a single russian on their team?
Even the casters like to suck on EG's dicks. Blitz for example is super biased when casting EG matches
Hey PPD how about you just beat them? If youre better you should go, right? No?
I thought he is the CEO of EG? What happened? I lost coverage to them since I am too hooked up to VP and Liquid. Please enlighten me
From what I see, this Russian guy completely understand him and in rage asking OP for help instead of afk farming. \n\nIdk game situation, but I think it's not common to someone to ask for a help, be totally ignored and rage about it. \n\nTranslation: \n\n&gt; Mk: fuck, I asked\n\n&gt; Mk: 2 times\n\n&gt; Mk: you free farmed\n\n&gt; SF: *quoting shit about language based matchmaking*\n\n&gt; Mk: well, fuck you (too)\n\nYes, it might seem like I'm trying to defend this guy but I'm just strongly disagree region lock idea. And more disagree on advertising region lock idea via posting screens from the games where both players are guilty in what happening in the game.\n\nEDIT: fixed translation
We don't know. MK might be used chat wheel which is auto translates sentences. Also MK might not want to be toxic for a team but he need to put his frustration in words that's why he is using Russian to flame. \n\nAll we see is just a part of discussion, quote taken out of context and working directly for those who want region lock to be a real thing.
dont forget that Lebron said he will consider joining GSW next season provided they can clear enough salary cap for him
ITT: people who don't understand bracket seeding.\n\nYes, this is a bad bracket. No, it's not because EG has an easy first round opponent. That's how it's supposed to work.
git fukin good either way you're going to have to beat the best team to qualify
hopefully this blows up and people realize arise is a shithead\n\nfucking idiot
arise is an ass....
Are yall on crazy pills? Every fucking russian i ran into with english as my preferred language could speak english. They just speak rus when  they don't care if you, OP, or some other fucking xenophobe understands them
Deepshit mentality. He had issues with every romanian team he played for.
~~Heh, he was one of the people who kept constantly spamming SingSing's donation messages with straight up racist and ontop of that extremely unfunny, beaten to death jokes when they used to party up a lot in the past.~~\n\n~~Not exactly sure why anyone would want Arise on their team so badly they would give up a player like Black (if the rumors are true)~~\n\nEDIT: Guess I was seriously wrong, rip me.
Ar1se has always been and will always be a cancerous shitter. He's a fucking manchild.
What an indecisive asshole.
I don't even care, I am an EG fan. The easy bracket is awesome! 
I checked your worldcloud and you're being mean in a video game. You deserve everything that happened and more. /s
Upvote, he is maybe good but he has weird personalities, anyone who likes him is probably his twitch viewers or subs. Poor Entity
Stop lying you retarded fucktard. How could you never be near any lane to gain exp from creeps or at least a cs for 5 minutes? That's impossible especially if you are turtling in base, because that's all you have to do. Be near your t3 and kill the creeps or def if they push, and people usually push with creeps by their side, so yeah.
google "Abed"
How the fuck did you manage to not be in 1500 range of xp for 5 min? That's retarded. Also sven is pretty good in pushing out waves, you wanna tell me you had 0 vision of void for 5 min to know you can help push out a wave or two?\n\nYou have no one to blame but yourself.\n\nedit: even the fucking [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ0DWNyRtrU) proves me right. He was sitting in base afk despite seeing void on the map several times. He could've gone to farm jungle camps, instead he was doing literally nothing.
the only tier 1 i can think of is Ohaiyo, but yeah if Arise cant play with A its definitely not him
How can this guy not tilt I'd beyond me
Hey man.  Sometimes you gotta poop.   Not saying you did, but shit happens.   Take the abandon and move on.
What a cancerous Shitstain
It's ridiculous that this is still in the game. A feature made for community management should NEVER affect your in-game decisions. If you want to do the Kunkka + Tinker fountain strat then you should be able to, but no, you can't in a pub. If your Ancient is exposed and you need one person to stay in base in case NP teleports, then you sure as fuck should be able to. But. You can't. \n\n&gt;bbbbut you can just go kill 1 creep in 5 minutes that's not a pr--\n\nYes, you can avoid afk punishment if you want to. The issue is that you have to.\n\nAFK detection should trigger on no player input and nothing else\n\n&gt;but what if someone just walks around the fountain to avoid it\n\nThen they're not AFK
Fuck arise 
Wooosh
stfu kid, loda is a fucking god
this ar1se dogshit was streaming everyday. He didnt wanted to go, because he said: "its too many hours to fly, too stacked etc".
Given how shit EG have been in the last 3 months this actually matters.\n\nThey could've very well lost to Optic/Col/Iceberg on any given day.\n\nHell, they still might not even make it with a pseudo direct invite like this.
4 comments by you and they're all negative. Maybe try commiting to a psychologist?
What DotA knowledge do u need to understand the brackets you moron?
Intended feature to punish turtle’s. Move on.
We're not discussiing top seed. We're discussing why the bracket EG (1) has 6, 7, 8 whilst the other Bracket has 2, 3, 4, 5.
lmao what a bipolar idiot. I thought I couldn’t make up my mind then I read this
This is so fucking stupid
I'm fine, thank you for your concern. I can see, that this is not the first time you are advising this. Personal experience? 
Based on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ0DWNyRtrU) he could've just gone and farmed the jungle since he saw void on the map depushing creepwaves.
Didn't farm for buy back (or at all) when he had full vision of them and lanes pushing in. Deserved.
So he was just sitting in base doing nothing. Working as intended tbh.
Well no one was bothered by it until Ppd point it out. It was out since Starladder 4. Some don’t even know what qualifiers is this for.
You sat afk and did nothing for 5 minutes, the system is working as intended\n\nlearn you scrub\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDQG-rIjxJ4
Yeah, after all the flame Loda got, team was a lot worse when he got kicked for Era.
I hope you do the same for Na'Vi
Germans are always 1 step ahead. Like'em.
Exactly. So many stupid comments here. How is it his fault?
birds need books
Dota will be dead by then, so it doesnt apply to us 
The only people willing to play with LODA
That is a bit wrong statement. \n\nWhat should system do? - detect afk players. \n\nNow it is made to reset special timer when you die or when you get xp. So he died, got reset, wasted 120s waiting to be alive, then he wasted another 3 mins hiding from void. So timer didn’t reset for 5 mins in total = he got an abandon. \n\nHow should it work to detect afk players in 100% cases and not to punish nice guys = that is hard question. \n\nYes, we can suggest some improvements... but that is different story. Basically, we should adapt to this and hope that Valve will do their best. 
at that point it isnt even practical anymore\n
If you are not happy we can swap places right now. I dont care what you do or where you live if it is in Germany, sign me up you filthy, \tunappeasable, spoiled brat.
1 abandon isn't a 6 month ban, it's a lesson learned.\n\nonly scrubs stay afk in base because they are too afraid to think, to put in 5 seconds of work into trying to guess where the enemy heroes are won't hurt them.
In his case he should've attempted to be near a creep in a window of 5 minutes. If any of my teammates manage to not get 1 single point of XP in 5 minutes i'd be glad for them abandoning.
No put it can put you into low priority for a few games which is basically hell. What if next time he has a legitimate reason to abandon (He is sick etc) and because he was kicked for no reason he has to play Low priority. 
There is no chance. This is bullshit.\n\n Esports, despite the name, are not sports, as their is no physical aspect to the taking part.
im offended take thijs down rite now
It's not a bug. If you can't get any experience in 5 minutes as sven, you are just bad at the game.
If what manager saying is true, then Arise seems like your average selfish douchebag.\n\nBut I also dont understand how can you, as a manager, do the same to this player A? You tell him yes when Arise says no, then no when Arise says yes and so on. Just make up your mind and take this player A without wasting his and everybodys time. Arise clearly is showing lack of motivation and yet you still trying.

I've nothing against video games, it is competitive. But, to me, it's not a sport. And it doesn't fit the definition above.\n\n\nEdit: downvote for a literal definition of sport. Good work guys
So you sat around in base for 5 minutes doing nothing instead of farming jungle or pushing out lanes...\n\nYou deserved it.
yeah they were 1 step ahead when they let in millions of illegal economic rapefugees
They're not trying to be discreet they just don't want two NA teams at their tournament. If they invite E.G then they have to still run an NA qual so they just roll the dice 
Is PPD really bitching about EG favouritism, which he up until recently benefited from, and also believed that he was entitled to (thinking of the chat logs where he refused to play a SA team on SA servers for one game).
"Yet I lost mmr after all that work." \nDude you are playing for wrong reasons.
If he's level 25 and doesn't know this is how u get afk abandon then it makes sense. Once you realise u just need a bit of exp than its easy to avoid, but it's still annoying
Nice summary.\n\nBut on the other hand I really hope to see people stop using outdated terms such as "Pos 1 = Carry, Pos 2 = Mid", that has not been the case in ages.
Can you read?
&gt;Germany was the home of numerous early esports adopters in the west, including hosting the first million-dollar tournament in Dota 2's The International [...]\n\nDidn't TI always take place in Seattle?
They weren't turtling. He's just an idiot. Turtling would mean he was on the defense, which he wasn't. They had mega creeps and the entire enemy team was defending on the other side of the map. Turtling my ass, OP is just a noob.
a kid that has never achieved anything and is playing in a team thats completely without a real chances to succed at the international?  \n
rofl
As someone who watches a lot of streams, I agree with you. I even watched his stream whenever he's playing magnus, those plays on Youtube were rarer than a unicorn. Iceiceice magnus is even better tbh. \n\nEdit: I'm not saying he's a bad magnus, he's a good magnus and definitely a million times better magnus player than me. I'm not just as amazed as the Youtube highlights compared to the games I've witnessed him play Magnus. I might just be unlucky to watch and he happened to have an unlucky match-up. Please do read carefully and with comprehension. Thanks.\n\nEdit: u/JohnyTheZick idgaf about downvotes tbh I'm just elaborating my point. Whiteknights are welcome to downvote me ^_^
This is fucking ridiculous.
Is he? I wa already downvoted for saying this but no, Black is not easy to work with and that's why most EU teams don't take him into account.\n\nI don't quite understand where does this nice Black image comes from tbh.
I would rather call it a flawed system than a bug
Fuck arise,what a moron.He wasted his teams time and now their team is gonna suffer a lot ,just cause this idiot was not able to make up his fucking mind,like hes a 13 year old or something
[A]lliance, take my energy!
Yeah and his team has a gem and it's not like he's going to be solo farming, his supports can back him up and counter any gank attempts. Plus he can see the enemy on the minimap. If they're missing, he can go back to base.\n\nYou're just making up excuses for him not doing anything when he could have farmed just fine. And the rest of his team was farming (watch sf in the video after dire takes rosh) and didn't magically die to this clinkz void duo. Not to mention after OP gets an abandon, he goes and farms 3 camps and somehow doesn't die. Yeah, literally impossible to avoid that.
You win games by changing a drafter 5 times a year? Sure look at Liquid and Secret 
Errr secret didn't have success for the majority of the last season. They acquired 2 good cores and 'suddenly' they're top of the ranking. VP have solo, ramzes and artstyle for drafting and they've been great for 2 seasons. The coL brothers have been average for as long as I remember 'despite' being supports.  \nYour point? 
This, exactly this! But the whole thread doesn't have 2000 mmr combined so they don't understand shit.
&gt; Once the SF respawned, he took the closest camps\n\nOh so it was safe for an SF who had the exact same vision and situation, but not for a sven. Makes sense, downvote away. Xddd\n\nThank god you pay attention to details.
Idk exactly but I would assume you should get an abandon if you stay fountain with your hero since there is always something to do. You can use ult and farm jungle while your bear pushes or you can push 2 lanes at the same time, there's really no logical reason to stay afk in fountain with the hero while pushing with the bear.
and how is that relevant? 
the music killed it for me...

Or only when you respawn? na brain
Who cares about that qualifiers? The real question is why NA has the same amount of slots as SEA for the main event?

Quod Erat Demonstrandum, a fancy, older than feudalism way to say 'that's the end of it'

OHAIYO WAS THE PROBLEM OMEGALUL
Yeah, it's not a bug. The intended consequence of someone not being within xp range for long enough is that they get an abandon. It's an imperfect solution, not a bug.
That's unfortunate, but I don't really see how Valve could improve the actual system.

Poor strategy aside op got punished for being afk while not afk. Are you just gonna ignore that?
EE said he is toxic or somehting..
Now Indogs have a team to cheer for instead of TNC hahahah
that was actually insane. No way you would think the real one is the one CHARGING your creepwave
He was scared to push, you're punishing a player for playing the game his own way? Sorry OP isn't divine 5 like you are.
They're still by and large the top team in the NA region, and in most sporting event the highest seeded team goes against the lowest one. I'm obviously biased but I really don't see much of an issue.
1) He's right\n2) He's not even lost yet and already blaming someone else
For some reason this had me dying in laughter and then slight tears followed lol
Remembering things that never happened is quite a task. Takes real effort to pull that off. Best of luck good sir.
Are you retarded? 
tbf the rest of team Romania are scumbags too. Never forget bone7 and cancel matchfixing in fpl\n
so mineski tnc boom id and xctn dont want to practice more and they want the upper bracket already? that's some bullshit reason you got
congrats, youve placed second among tier3 teams, pretty cool. 
haha got'em!
Wow, that's exceedingly dumb that Na'Vi jumps from 11th to 5th by poaching a player off of VP.\n\nOh well, if Na'Vi keeps doing Na'Vi things, the system will correct itself by August.
If Lebrun became a pro Dota player, would it be the most impressive thing ever?
No lol
Imagine that Sven got that notification being catched in chrono from some insane initiation... \n\nHe would lose control, get distracted, fail to press all buttons and lose the game eventually. \n\nI got triggered even by steam notifications about people coming online sometimes. \n\nThat is definitely not cool. But of course your suggestion can work sometimes. But I hope one day we will get Machine learning algorithms for that :D 
EE is overrated as fk i dont understand how people cant appreciate this fact

Sorry, but it isnt even a thing yet. Germany does NOT have a government coalition (yet), so there is NOTHING to talk about. \n\nThey talk more about immigrants and such stuff and not about videogames at olympics.

he's playing monkey king in game 3....
It's not so dramatic in reality.  \n\nI just watched the replay at 0.25 speed player perspective \nPhantom Lancer\n\nHe starts out with an illusion and main PL.  Sends the illusion and main PL north.  \n\nHe mantas (original illusion still going north), picks one manta clone and sends it south to the wooded area.  \n\nThe main and second manta clone just auto attack the nearby Lifestealer.  \n\nSorry to disappoint you.  
Knew I'd regret swapping out my flair soon enough. ;(\n\nLong live [A]lliance! 
What the duck are you even saying here?  Did you really drop an “N“ bomb?

whats up with you pinoys. you cant hold a conservation about somebody's else, as soon as you notice that you have nothing left to say you just go on the person you are talking with
If it becomes part of mainstream career,s it can start counting in your extra curriculars. Universities can start allocating scholarships to it. The casting industry can be revitalized. More tournaments. More viewers. And last of all, this stigma, that lumps esports athletes and wannabe players with no gooders who drink redbull and while their lives away while getting no where, can start getting removed. When someone who truly has a gift for wants to pursue it, he wont have to fight against the whole of society as well as his opponents in the game.
Alliance pls loose

Pointing out shitty arguments != being a fan
Wtf dude what do the pro players have to do with this? Ofc there is no reason to stay in fountain for longer than 1 minute in any game at any stage of the game with any hero, btw I'm talking about decent mmr games here where players actually use the map they play on
All these non-answers. You guys are fucking morons.
idiot
I think that Wyk is IceFrog. Is that true?
any proof?
LMAO wow what an insanely huge announcement to make AFTER the roster lock.  gj valve
Please don't feel
I think you missed a 0 from the MMR
I mean, 0800 is just ~~k~~nit picky and petty. 
That is true but this is a brand new system this year and it's different than what was on their FAQ until right now since it had been saying there would be a penalty but it sounded like you could still qualify on points.\n\nedit: AND this kind of goes against what their old policy had been.  It had been all about how their invites are to individual players when era was going to get subbed out which actually works with the individual players having points but now this makes their policy being invites to individual players as long as they're staying in their locked teams.
compelling argument except for all the words on their website in the FAQ https://medium.com/@anthonyhodgson/dear-valve-what-does-the-roster-lock-actually-mean-219fe6fc5900 \n\n  I'll go with screenshots instead of you just being wrong.
Not known to us as viewers. 
This isn't consistent with the era situation though\n\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2014/6/27/5850520/valve-dota-2-the-international-fnatic-era \n &gt; WHEN WE INVITE A TEAM OF FIVE PLAYERS, WE ARE IN FACT INVITING THOSE FIVE PLAYERS.\n\nIndividual players now having DPC points actually works completely with their policy that had been inviting individual players as a team.  That and their DPC FAQ never saying anything other than point penalties for breaking locks did NOT make this an intuitive result.
But teams that have players that can't get visas to play can still use standins?\n\nSo you can't get an invite unless you just say your team that you plan to play with is the registered roster. Only to use a stand in during the tourney at TI.\n\nDid Empire get invited or did they go through Open Quals last year?
That information was the only thing available for the DPC which is the system for being invited to TI.  the tweet came after the last roster lock.  Considering it's a brand new system what happened in TI6 is not relevant.  
It wasn't already stated. There is even a "new" label tagged on the side. However, changing rosters did cause you to go through open quali's before,  this happened to EG in TI6 iirc, but the roster lock wasn't 6 months before TI. There were multiple lock periods through the year. \n\n6 months in Pro dota is an extremely long time. Not only that.. but we are going to be having patches every 2 weeks. That will probably make the meta fairly turbulent, causing playstyles to need to be very flexible. This means that rosters with players who  aren't as flexible will struggle more.\n\nThey have to roster swap after the lock or do what they can to learn and adapt.\n\nThis is an incredibly huge announcement. Good or bad is yet to be seen.
It's a public stance they took on invitations to TI and it's a stance they took that works with their new system of individual players having points. 
The exact situation is not known publicly obviously but it was stated he had anxiety issues and the team appeared to want to play with someone else and were pressuring him to not play.  Iirc Era did still want to play or else they would have been able to sub him out with valve's blessing but it all got really awkward.
Valve's statement was about individual players being invited.  This new system gives individual players points, so cool, now it's really like individual players are being invited!  Their website only said that breaking roster locks would cost them some unknown number of points but now it turns out it costs them all their points and all their new teammates their points and also they aren't considered for invitations to the regional qualifiers.  Yes this IS how things worked in the old system but we have a new system and this latest tweet is not in line with how the new system appeared to be working.  \n\n  All this stated I'm totally fine with how they ARE doing it I just think that this is a very important rule that should have been stated from the start.
Points belong to the team right? Did it change?
Totally agreed. The individual player points became meaningless after this new announcement. This is a very important news but Valve announced it after the final roster lock before TI8.
Why isn't this Dota gameshow sponsored by BestMeta Tokens? \n\nI thought all the casters and studios wanted to be paid with BestMeta?
There are a lot of major tournaments left but the recent roster lock period is the last one before TI. \nI think if Valve planed to announce this news, they should have another roster lock period before TI8.
Yeah, they don't have another roster change period. I just thought Valve should have it. Also, Valve never said you can only change players on the stated period or all the points you earned will become useless for TI invites. Valve only mentioned point penalty before. Now, they said no more change after this roster lock or you have to play open qualifers for TI. No more point penalty policy applied from now till TI8. 
So, GG Na'vi?
I believe a lot of teams did change players and got a penalty on points earned before this add and drop period.\n
Because a lot of people thought add and drop periods are only for points penalty.
The DPC points did change that rule. Not by statement but by implication.\n\nWHAT IF WE NEED TO MAKE ROSTER CHANGES AFTER THE LOCK?\nPlaying with a roster that's significantly different from a registered roster will incur point penalties, similar to using subs (see the FAQ on Majors and Minors).\n\n see http://www.dota2.com/majorsregistration/home/\n\nValve's new statement is a direct contradiction to their previous statement.\n\nA point penalty is mute if you swap after the lock because you forfeit all points as you can no longer be invited directly or to the regionals.\n\nNo one assumed that if you swapped you would be forced to play opens. That is why up to this point, there was always the question about players swapping right before TI to make it into the top 8 DPC position and getting an invite.\n\nThe new statement also eliminates the idea of individual players having points... Puppey could leave Secret right now, having one of the hightest individual point totals... but it doesn't matter. Both puppey's new team and secret could not be invited to TI as they would have broken the roster lock.\n\nSaying DPC didn't change anything is just not accurate.\n
What is the different between teams not locked for majors/minors and those for TI? I thought teams locked for TI also locked for major/minors from now on after this announcement (which makes the points penalty policy meaningless) or the points they earned become useless for TI invite because they change 1 player for example.
A lot of teams have changed their roster since sept 5th 2015 :thinking:\n\nhttp://www.dota2.com/majorsregistration/home/\n&gt; WHAT IF WE NEED TO MAKE ROSTER CHANGES AFTER THE LOCK?\nPlaying with a roster that's significantly different from a registered roster will incur point penalties, similar to using subs (see the FAQ on Majors and Minors).\n\nThat page doesn't even reflect the changes on the FAQ yet where they finally clarified that your points are meaningless if you break the lock.
what the fuck is wrong with all these redditors acting like their assumptions based on things that happened in the old system were somehow "known".  No.  you made assumptions based on an old system while Valve made a brand new system and Valve finally states that "okay sure we'll just do what the old system was because people pointed out we hadn't actually made rules for it" so they feel "so smart".  People smarter than these people were wondering what the rules were because they hadn't fucking said anything about it.  so fucking triggered.
If you are not a locked team, you cannot be invited to TI sir.\nAlso, locked teams change 1 or 2 players before and still earned some points, but after this final roster lock period and the recent valve's announcement, teams cannot do that anymore.
Looking now into the dates, teams are abusing the lock period. Both VP and Na'vi would be out of the run cause they dropped players after the drop lock (phase 1), but both teams registered with only one player on the roster drop phase and included the rest in the end.\n\nTeams should keep their rosters on the list from one season to the other, to prevent those kind of moves and defend players. Considering lil wasnt happy about being replaced, it do matter.
My point here is the final lock period is too far from TI and there are a lot of important tournaments left but team cannot change players and get reduced points as a penalty anymore.
Huh? All teams are now locked. Meaning if you change at any time before TI, you cannot, even if you have the Highest DPC points, be invited to TI or the regional.\n\nYou didn't address any of Valves official statements that disqualify yours. \n\nIndicating that if you swapped after locked, you would receive a point penalty, implies very distinctly, that the points you received from future tournaments would still be legitimate in the DPC standings. The new statement directly disqualifies you from any potential invite whatsoever, regardless of points. \n\nSo Valve "clarified" the situation by directly contradicting the implications of their previous statements?\n\nAnd as I have stated elsewhere.. there were multiple roster locks per year for TI6 and TI7. This year, for the TI8 season.. there was one. It just passed. \n\nTI is at least 6 months away. Previously locks were way closer to TI than this years.\n\nBut you're probably right. The rules were so clear that Scantzor wrote a lengthy article about how concise and obvious the situation was, leading to the statement by valve concerning the roster lock.\n\n\n
If that is the case, VP and Navi should be punished because they dropped players after the drop period. There were a rule stating that you cannot drop players after drop period, am I right?
If this is the case, why does Valve give the points penalty rule for 2-3 players change? You can give a valid reason for 1 player unable to play, but for 2-3 players, well.... \nI think Valve initially thought teams can change players and get reduced points as a penalty, but then a question about open qualifiers came up and they have to announce the latest news, am I right?\nValve should have done this at the beginning of this season though. \n
I don't think you understand what the Roster Lock is and how DPC points actually work. Let me re explain this to you clearly.\n\nFor the TI8 season, there is,was, and will only be one roster lock period. That period started presumably started after TI, as Valve only indicates the phase one ended 1/22/18. Since no team that swapped players- essentially every team but liquid and Newbee- was ever penalized for swapping said players... we know that there was no "locked" teams as you seem to think.\n\nPhase 2 ended yesterday.\n\nUp till yesterday... no team was "locked", all teams were unlocked. So no... you couldn't have been "unlocked until now, earning reduced points"---- that's a quote from you by the way----\n\nTeams are now locked... this is, and was, and will be (unless valve contradicts what they said today) the only roster lock until TI. Meaning that up till this point no one assumed that you would have to go through opens if you swapped.\n\nIf you still can't see this, I can't help you man. But good luck.
That's not true. The FAQ was edited just before he made that tweet, and it even shows as much in the FAQ with a clear 'NEW' tag.
thats the most confusing thing I ever read.
So let's say, ace and midone left team secret and for giggles joined fnatic. Would the new fnatic roster get all those points?
Na is known for being a strong region
While they might be dead in the pro scene, Synd and bulldog can certainly bring good entertainment to stuff like this. Kind of like a worse slacks who can play dota.
Damn
Who gives a toss. It's just a tiny stone of stumbling. 
learn to read fucking retard
I  like tttheee people .
Not with trump in charge. 
It's in Trophies
It shouldn't be hard when you have no competitor, look at eu or cn, their top 10 changes all the time
Recently got an aegis steal and a 1v3 as Bristle.\n\nHe's a little too strong, honestly. He's like Ursa, except I'd say stronger. Longer uptime on tanking, ranged AoE nuke, and nicer earlygame.
You think it's a reference to Doki Doki? :O
1st phase ban material
my man. I misread the title but your response reminded me of myself. upvoted
Nice. Now come over and do it in SEA
Alliance fanshit talking about strong and weak regions LMAO your garbage team wouldn't qualify no matter what region they were in 
Not even that, those trophies show the int ranked mmr.
once saw timber killing a creep mid air with Q and didn't die, thought its intended.
Valve has bent just about every rule they've implemented in the past, so we should wait and see.
And here was i, happy with my two top 800 accs.
To bad they are getting stomped.
vi von
There is nothing to explain, you just have to read the words.

Why is smurfing acceptable when only specific people do it?
And people have the audacity to question if he has a shit ass weak mental game or not\n\nHe's obviously beyond talented, he just tilts under pressure. Clear as day  
Envy said before the pizza arrived. But ohaiyo said otherwise.
Some people think he *doesn't* have a weak mental game, I'm saying it's obvious he *does* have a weak mental game 
thanks for erasing 7 years of progress
This just shows the skill level of the KKona brackets. No wonder they get humiliated over and over and over again in international competitions. Muricans having invites to tournaments while half of their players are from Sweden or Denmark is an abomination.
I understand the meaning behind Valve's announcement. But do you agree with me that after first roster change period, teams thought they could change their roster freely (using sub with no valid reason), only got reduced points as a punishment, and they did that even before the recent final roster lock. People thought teams could ignore roster lock and bring 1-2 players from Secret or Liquid, and still qualify for TI, but things have changed now. \nAlso, in my opinion, the final roster lock period is too early because there are a lot of important tournaments until TI.
If that were the case, PPD wouldn't have written snap before Kyle mentioned milk.
SAVAGE
Why create a folder if its just a meme. And i dont think beating Alliance as og means thay are back at being top tier.They just beat another tier 2 team.
DOESNT THIS AT ALL WORK
Because it’s his job to play dota. This is all he does 24/7.\n\nIf someone has a 55% winrate then someone who plays 1000 games is gonna have a higher mmr than someone who plays 100 games. Even tho both have the same rate of success which could arguably translate to same level of dota skill, one will have a higher mmr just from sheer number of games played.
Alright man haha the guy was just making a joke, don’t have to get too worked up about it!:-) have a great day ahead anyway buddy
Any examples?
How many Internationals has he won now?
WORK AT THIS ALL DOESNT
THIS WORK AT ALL DOESNT
Arteezy is a great player, but there's gotta be a reason he hasn't won a Valve event yet.
It doesnt work, almost as much as the new Mercedes Benz E-Class Sedan. The most intelligent E-Class family of all time welcomes a powerful new member to the dynasty. The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque — the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury. Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. "Car-to-X" Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles — effectively allowing it to "see" around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems — including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC®, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist — feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them. Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven, and more than lives up to the dream. Look for the E400 4MATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900
Profile -&gt; stats (where you can see all your hero stats) -&gt; top right corner. There's your mmr.
You can make a 1000 threads of rtz Manta dodging or of how high his mmr is, that doesnt make him win Lan events LUL
So when Wykhrm gives us this update, it means Wykrhm = Icefrog?
Nicer early game than Ursa? You are playing bad lanes then LUL. \n\n
How do you know hes American? because he supports eg?\n\nBesides culture can vary from state to state especially for big nations.
ease glap el you el
Even mentioning ursa and good in the sane sentence OMEGALUL
Take a chill pill man. Hahaha
You can literally see your MMR on your stats page... The fuck are you little shits crying about?\n
Well eg is shaky indeed and i do enjoy seeing salty eg fanboys when they cry or there is an upset like how they lost to vgj.But tier 2 hell no.
Pick drow,buy morick mask and beat the shit out of BB. But make sure u have ur back up when have its own other wise one on one BB is dead meat. It works for me.
You're overthinking it. It's a joke about a cuckold relationship in which ppd is the cuck and Kyle the bull. It's like next-level infidelity, the biggest insult to masculinity Kyle could enunciate.
Except it really isn't all that hard to avoid being level 4 at 10 minutes. If you can't play against the trilane you need to get a support to duo with you after the first few minutes while trying to pull the wave or dying for a wave or two of xp.\n\nBristle can easily get level 2-3 in a trilane by 5-6 minutes at the latest, the problem I see is that most bristle players are braindead &amp; just walk up nonchalantly to the creep wave to feed.
Why does MK's q have a lifesteal again? 
Or both, because the stuff the two of them can do with milk, well, I can't just post that in a public forum like this.
They haven't implemented it yet. Remember they didn't specify when they'll do it. Valve time c;
You get to hide your mmr like a baby boy so we should get to show our mmr so people know our worth as a player.
Want ez karma? flame EG. ez reddit points
You talking about PPDs mum? 
Fnatic?
correction, why does MK have lifesteal at all? 
A ward is just two creeps. Buy your own if you want to win.
2 profile pictures and a dog....
I don't smurf, but why doesn't he just play a lobby then? Really hope you're not just a RTZ fanboy
That's actually true
Or the joke wasn't about milks at all.\n\nAlso, didn't think, not didn't thought.
What is Blake*
ez
odpixel sucks liquids dick for 20 minutes \n\nrdota2 "haha wow I sure loev my favorite caster Od Pixel resident Liquid blowjob caster"\n\nEG gets praised for 1 minute\n\nrdota2 "WOW i will not stand for such BIASED casting in the year 2018 I will be emailing BTS sponsors this is OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
He knows de wae 
Unbiased? Now they're just biased *against* EG. 4Head
Same bb is a dead meat for me.
Holy fuck I missed a Slacks Cast??? Brb, vodding that shit\n\nAlso, you guys need to be a bit more agile on the production side. Most of the early part of the EG-IDC cast had problems on slacks' side of the audio, and twitch chat was bringing it up the entire time.\n\nBut that was a super fun cast, loved it.
I mean, what do people expect?  2 of the elite core players (aka position best for climbing mmr) who have the ability to grind an absurd amount of games (which is the most important factor for gaining mmr) are atop mmr leader boards. 
i would prefer they announce this one week before ti8 so we can laugh at the dirty teams trying to buy high dpc players. \n\n*stares in navi's direction. 
I've had incredible success with the 6 or 7k, #1 bristle build discussed on true dota a while back. Offlane, treads, stick if needed, midas, heart, blademail, two more hearts. You hard farm your first heart in less than 15 minutes without pressure and around 17 to 18 with, joining fights to finish them in between. Fly yourself salves and clarities to never stop farming. After first heart, you lead every teamfight and occasionally stop fighting only to allow heart to activate.
Slacks should not ever cast.  Let him do interviews or skits or whatever, I'm happy to skip that content of his.  Sucks having to watch RawDota or something just to avoid an obnoxious Slacks cast.
And Water is wet.
Retard alert, retard alert retard alert.
i would care if solo mmr was a thing still. it's now meaningless. team mmr and solo should be seperate objectively
so VP is the big evil orange bear? and navi is just a meek yellow duck getting pushed around? 
I think u never tried this or u never face any drow player who can do this.
Why? So you can show off to your friends and feel good about it?
Retard alert, retard alert retard alert. Drow has to be fucking fat as a pregnant lady to even think about fucking with BB. BB will send her back to base early game every 2 mins.
what. the. actual. fuck. everyone knows that you don't touch your hair when you are on a winning streak. you let that shit grow forever until you lose.
Stop trying, it doesn't work!
btw you guys should watch last eg vs secret match. casters were talking how secret was in deep trouble , they are making mistakes then secret won 2-1.lets not go talk about their prediction also. some casting surely was biased .
Liquid has 4 9k mmr players and is the most dominant team in the scene now, so ya Dendi, mmr is just a number kappa 
The number of fucke u used here ,I can buy wand from it and tangos too.
I dont know if you don't have much human interaction in your basement but the "its your mom/gf calling, you forgot to buy X" is a thing you learn at 12 and everyone uses it. 
Well good luck then. Clearly you never got a proper bashing. Hit me up when the day comes.
SYND OMEGALUL
They're correct tho, eg struggles to get more than 10 kills against good teams atm
How was the Facebook “minor”?
Guessing the basher when they're all like level 8 wasn't exactly the smartest decision NotLikeThis
Where is the TLDR
Trying too hard you karma whore
@ /r/imbogey\n\nwhat have you done. Matumbamans messy hair was his lucky charm. Good luck winning another major without it. He probably has lost a lot of self esteem now, which will affect his gameplay negativly. Well done. GG. Reported. Kappa.
I'm pretty sure the majority of people who flaunt their mmr don't give a shit about "how each patch affected your MMR over the years and you could find out what meta (and by extension, playstyle) fit you best."
Because they are all insanely individually skilled. Post ppd they can't seem to mesh at all though.
That's for other people you...
And he cant win shit with his team!\n\nSays alot about what attitude you need to have to make it into the pro scene.
how did he jump ? he had no vision on enemy players
No practical implications since there is a lot of situational stuff\n\n\n\n\nLike if PA went brown boots bkb by 18 min hello minus winrate\nIf pa massacred everyone and doesn;t need a bkb early hello +winrate\n\n\nDota is too versatile
do we really have the largest fanbase on reddit ? pretty sure it's navi. 
Quality shitpost.
TLDR: item timings do matter but how much , it depends on item and which hero. also skipping smaller items to rush important items is bad.
Fat retarded moron trying to be funny again.
Just curious if it was an actual article or just the timings
Im talking about winning. He hasnt won anything major.
ITS ME TRASH\nYOOOOOO\nWE WERE IN DISCORD WHEN YOU MADE THIS BOI
What's the point of this post?
B-but he didn't even check the tinker's items\n\nIs there a graphic/audio cue for gaining stick charges??
How much games does Arteezy have on his smurf? I’m sure his smurf at the top has way more than 200-500.\n\nIt’s easy to have a 70% WR if you only have 200-500 games and are playing people well below your skill level. It should drop to 55/60% once they consistent play against high level opponents.
Some EG games are really hard to watch because casters are really biased. I mean Nahaz is the worse of them, I have to mute him when he casts EG games, but at least he admits it. I guess it's hard to stay neutral when your favorite team casts, whoever you are. \n\n\nThey should let bulldog cast again because hes favorite team is Alliance and they never win, so he can't be biased while casting. 
Can we just share it over the api for dotabuff/opendota to track? Im okay with it that u cant show it ingame, because there is already the medals..
Why do people keep telling me that. Yeah, silver edge is a fine-ass item to get but how am I supposed to get a silver edge when he is tower diving me at level 7. He hits like a truck and runs so fast. I can't show in lane unless I've got like 5 levels on him and 2 supports, both of which are likely to die to his fucking quill spam
from a neutral point as i supported alliance and og ,i remember exact same reaction towards navi from eg fans in 2015-16.these eg fans were saying navi is trash overrated and disband. na dota is the best.casters are biased towards navi. i think eg deserves hate bcz of their fans.
Are we still going to argue about our different interpretations of what "making it" means? I've already explained my view on it. I meant winning. You downvoting me isnt gonna change anything.\n\nMy point stands : Good player with shit attitude, thats why he hasnt won anything significant. 
"Regular sports" don't have patches that entirely change game come out every few months.
do it /u/SirActionSlacks
god, i would love EE vs Ohaiyoo at DAC. GEBAK!!
no thx. i rather Fnatic failed to qualify LOL
LFY vs Big God is heavily scripted n 322'd lmao. Live rate jumped mad
Neither of them will qualify lul.
Ohaiyo was always and is a great player!!
For the record often times I too enjoy watching more than playing, but the fact that I do still play - I feel - is important in keeping my understanding of the game current\\relevant. Perhaps I'm exaggerating the importance of playing, i don't know - but OPs post about benchmark item timings leads me to believe I'm not flat out wrong either.
people actually do this? wow
Probably because it actually is the victim. Reddit is a pack of hyenas that get satisfaction in putting other people down.\n\nYou guys are ridiculous, constantly constantly shitting on EG for losing against liquid even though liquid literally won TI, and that EG have no idea how to beat them, like how VP can't win vs EG. But who shits on VP? No one does because the wild animals here know that there isn't any VP fans, *so why shit on a team if it doesn't make the fans upset?*. You are literally bullies trying to ruin people's day. \n\nIt's so goddamn obvious what you people are trying to do, and yet at the same time you people wonder why everyone thinks this subreddit is a toxic shithole.
EE was the problem 
EE is the problem because he is the drafter.. He drafts around himself instead of around Abed.\n\nIm trash compared to him, but i think he is a bad carry player and its holding Fnatic back.
An older meme sir, but it checks out.
Justice for Ohaiyo!:P
Man why do teams keep on picking Invoker? Hero needs to be almost 6 slotted basically to do anything.
Hex on Ursa. New meta!
What the fuck \n\nAre you having a stroke?
i think ee was the captain in secret, CMIIW
Abed always throw on invoker. Also tinker is so broken rofl. When are they gonna nerf perms hex
EternalNoob LUL
Not banning Karl's santino who rekt mineski yesterday LUL just arrogant
i do not believe bullshit like this or that ti curse that has never existed
[Loda's reaction to this bug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWnfkHgnJ7U#t=5s)
Really they should nerf being able to Rearm+Blink out while taking damage. 
they lost the game because the tb is burning 
Yeah that too. Fuck tinker , most tilting hero ever 
If you read my comment you would have noticed I never mentioned myself\n\nI'm not nice, but I don't randomly insult people for choosing to be a fan of another team.
every lost game is blamed on ee, haven't you read reddit?
What you mean ti curse has never existed? Its a fact that west and east were taking turns in winning TI since beginning.
Snitch HYPERBRUH 
No thanks, i rather EE doesn't qualify. 
not if used by miracle.
I can take it, it just makes me hate you all.\n\nEspecially when I see you in future threads trying to take the moral highground on a topic 
ti curse is about ti winner falling into the dumpster
it bugs me that he still said "he didn't get the..." even after just clicking a creep
I suppose the /s is there for a reason

the stats say so, what can i say?
Imho its ok if its still professional. Like if your national sport team plays the casters are also biased. The analysis is obviously more important, but they still try to hype their own team as much as possible
?
wait, no more invis on web now? 
Obviously, no one is targeting any individual person. But to say that people are not trying to attack other fans is pretty naive.\n\nYeah, ignoring everything is definitely an option, but so is having basic decency and respect. You have to ignore some things to stay sane, but to ignore everything?
Too EEz 
If you say so
Taking a win against Big God is already not bad
PPD - The biggest joke of this season. This guy is doing nothing but getting slapped again and again. TI winner? My ass.
superpower by 2020 btw
and you think rtz is!! xd..hes just like "get me out of this game boisss ,hehehhe m done "..and press new game 
SeemsGood THANKS S4 SeemsGood
you must be blind if you think abed is sacrificed for envy rofl
Classic Loda, if there's void, ck or lycan involved you can bet he's gonna choke.
Very nice. Clap.
I disagree. If someone has put a lot of hard work into grinding out mmr why shouldnt they be proud of it and want to display it? Mmr is still technically in the game,why not let us show it as before. It's nice having a badge which represents a certain skill bracket but the original rank status still clearly matters to quite a few users.
&gt;bulldog noticed this\n\nAnyone who has played the game has noticed this.
Nippy
C'mon buddy, you can do better\n\nThis "omg he said somthing, 10k [insert here something barely relevant] xDD" is so cliché 
What you mean? It's not that you typed anything wrong, it's that your sentences don't make basic sense 
Who still thinks universe is a downgrade to ohaiyo lmfao...
Fnatic didnt have any noteworthy results before Universe either ..
Top 3 for A: Liquid, VP, Mineski\n\nTop 3 for B: Secret, Newbee, LGD
Sure I could do better just don’t feel the need to actually put effort into replying to an idiot on the Internet 
OG hasn't done anything special after TI either..
ahahaha newbee twitter account delivers again. ahaha damn these two twitter accounts are so damn funny hahaa. they make so funny jokes really i cant even think of these jokes because i know i will get upvoted to the sky. but its  newbee twitter guy you know? THE NEWBEE TWITTER GUY everyone knows here who makes so damn funny memes  for example this. this is so funny man my guts are flying in the  sky with tesla in space
These Tier 3 and Tier 4 SEA teams like BOOM and Fire Dragoon and Execration might look alright taking some games off the Tier 1 teams like TNC and Fnatic\n\nBut we have to remember that it's very easy for them to look good when they basically spent like years preparing to face only these Tier 1 teams, while TNC and Fnatic do no preparation to face these noob teams.\n\nSo it's easy for them to beat them in a BO1 or BO3, but Fnatic and TNC will do way better in a tournament with proper teams, since in reality they are far more skilled and better strategised.
No
Limit should be 322 games
It's very easy for these trash teams to beat these Tier 1 teams like TNC and Fnatic in BO1 or take 1 game in BO3.\n\nBut its mostly just because they are super try-hard and research these teams for 24 hours a day 365 days a year to try and win.\n\nIn reality they are still trash Tier 3 teams compared with Fnatic and TNC.
SoBayed
Balanced draw tbh. Sick of seeing EG in easier groups. They deserve this after lucking out real hard in other tourneys.
How about VP Secret Newbee Liquid, are they Tier 0??\nMeaning to say Tier 0 do no preparation to face these noob teams like Fnatic and TNC???\n\nWhat kind of trash logic is that??
He was also out of range.
Not enough upvotes you baboons 
Once again Optic will finish a tournament in last place
I still doubt they are tier 1 in SEA. 
Losing to BoomID sounds like a downgrade to me. We shall see how they do against Mineski/TNC
Liquid sucks, just saying.\n
For the downvoters, here is the [context](https://twitter.com/SumaaaaiL/status/956864236679917569)
Lucking out how? LMFAO

How is that true, it is the same system nothing has changed just now u have stupid badges in your profile thats all. Why u want a stupid number there also ? The whole MMR system is bad since start idk how people are actally liking it, I think they dont thats why the game is dead for a year. 
Me too, me too.
So what's T2 in SEA then?
I stand corrected, at least for Universe part.

Shouldnt we be given the option to display it? It was there once,no reason take it away. Sure some people are obsessed with mmr,but also a huge number of people who arnt that simply want to display the rank which they earned via hard work. Its perfectly normal for people to want to show off their achievements.
Of course not. They never prepare for noob teams.

I dont agree. The torrent did the same job at the same time. Ohayio would still get 4 people in his ult even if kunkka wasnt in the game. Sure the torrent hit first, but do you really think that SK wouldnt have hit that stun on those people without it? 
"SOMEWHAT CONSISTENTLY" \n\nEG beat VP like 15 of 16 bo3 or higher series in a row. 
This shit has been going one since at least TI4, it rarely gets on reddit though.\n\nEven if you ban commending in bot matches, people will still do that by abusing matchmaking with the system everyone used to 3 star battlepass quests. The same system people in lpq use to get out fast even if they dont want to pay igor or oleg 3-4$ to get boted out.\n\nThis subreddit orgasms every time some poor soul gets sent to LPQ, but the repeated offenders and the people that are actually awful know how to abuse Dotas systems, exploiting various things in this game has been a thing since bloody 2012 when i started playing.\n\nThe people that are suffering through lpq are people with internet connection issues, people that get tilted easily but at base are normal players and the people who are to dumb to know how to game the system.
That makes it worse

dat cursor movement! \n\ncheat confirmed. however, i cant help but be amazed to the people who makes these "scripts". I dont even have a single idea how to make them or how they are ran.
Yes, playing it on slow motion is pretty clear.\n\nIn this clip the unclear part was wether she precasted it or not, since she had vision. But we can that not only is it not instant(there is like 0.1-0.2 of a second before she actually silences you, meaning it was not precasted, and that if u go slowmotion u can see the cursor wasnt even on u.;
True if true
no he did not, he just had a better gaming carpet than you.

literal 1k garbage
almost certainly yes, u can tell by where his cursor is.  but if it makes u feel better, casting orchid before rp isnt terribly difficult if the player is ready for it, but in this case it was a cheat.

So Singing fly every other week for shooting?

I seem to always forget that the item gives attack speed (probably because none of the components do). Factoring that in makes it a lot better on some supports then just the active alone would make it, so don't forget about that fact like me!\n\nEdit: And I'm doubly an idiot for not realizing Shadow amulet itself gives attack speed.
The concept is pretty cool but execution is so-so for me. I really think the theme song needs to be changed, it sounds like a sarcastic parody of game show intro music. Singsing is not a great guest either, he barely speaks and has no on-camera confidence. Also there should be more rounds where the two teams are competing in a much more direct manner, like answering 1 question each in some sort of 'lightning round', or just throwing questions open and any team can answer using a buzzer. And I get why you want lots of Dota guests to start with since thats what your followers know, but a more diverse range of esports guests from other games - people you could introduce to us by posting mini bios/profiles on social media, for example, before an Ep. is released - would help spice things up too. Seeing the guests actually PLAY games or do something game-related -- making the viewing experience kinda similar to Twitch streams -- might also be fun!    \n  \n    \nedit: I see now that towards the end of Episode 3 there was a lightnting round. Says a lot though that I didn't even get that far into the episode to realise. Tobi having to yell STOP was also quite cringe :( seemed genuinely angry. Gotta let that banter run free! The contestants are mature enough to get back on track eventually when the joke stops being funny.
Simple man, I see AM getting shrekt, I like
That phase boot got me\n\nmuh sides :D\n\nWell, it's technically really good - nice gradients and all, but artistically pretty meh

I'm willing to bet that the AM sucks. There was no reason whatsoever to hit Tide for that long and blink into enemy base, unless he literally just gave up at that point which is also possible and he just wants his misery to end.
[AM Hits him long time long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP7utU8Efow)
Could it be an Open AI bot. I've actually heard that valve is using them in way more games than people think. 
Yeah it was really a stroke of genius to add that feature, Valve! \n\nI mean the absolute mind-bending sheer force of will and enlightenment that must've given rise to the epiphany that hit the 1 guy at Valve to add this feature.\n\n\nValve probably had to double their Dota 2 division because that 1 guy has now transcended the physical plane and can only work on the Reporting System from another dimension.
It's not like this tide is stacked with defensive items.
Oh man, I love to see an AM sad.
You mean other than greaves?
probably he's too cool for this.
I definitely mean including the greaves\n\nEdit: wow, for all the slow people, he didn't have greaves for most of the clip
Here are some suggestions to take or leave from someone who enjoyed the idea but felt the execution could be a little better. For the record, I didn't watch any of the previous two episodes.\n\n*Round 1* worked well enough, but suffered from the fact that the teams felt very separate. Part of this was because you did one full team after the other as opposed to having a back and forth between them. \n\nMaybe instead of each team choosing their own category and getting six questions from it, each team could choose a category and then both teams are read three questions from each?\n\nEven better might be a Big Fat Quiz style quiz, where you ask both teams the same six questions. For each one, both teams would confer, write down an answer, and then reveal them at the same time.\n\n*Round 2* was fun, the only possible change I'd make is instead of having one person draw three things under pressure, have them forced to also switch out between drawings like a relay. \n\n*Round 3* felt the easiest, but you said it was more difficult in earlier episodes. The one thing that came to mind might be having four people and three quotes instead of three people and three quotes. It would change the dynamic with the process of elimination.\n\n*The final round* seemed like the roughest, for rule flaws that came out during the show. Instead of removing a point for a wrong answer, which is what you almost ended up doing, I think it would be a much better idea to give the other team a chance to get it right for two points. \n\nThat way there's a bit of a risk to instantly buzzing in if you don't know the answer to one that feels "easy" but if you do end up having a good guess you can still take a shot without a guaranteed penalty.
First of all: just Monika. Almost missed my /r/UnexpectedDDLC moment there.\n\nFor the rest, I guess it's subjective whether 20m greaves constitutes being "defensively stacked" on a Tide.\n\nMy thinking was that for all the duration of the clip tide was &gt; 20% hp. Once he was under that, he'd get an extra 15 armor and 12 regen. Between that, Kraken Shell, and Anchor Smash, I'm not sure AM could EVER kill Tide (in that particular fight).\n
Looks like a classic Pump and Dump.
I don't think you can selectively do that for matches
SPIT ON DE FALSE QUEEN
can you tag his steam id here so we can all steam report him or smth
You mean like the lightning round they did every episode at the end of each round, where the teams get open questions and can answer using a buzzer?
so why exactly is AM not using his ult? even a level 1 mana void should have gotten a kill there
Well the thing is, positive reinforcement (commends in this instance) would not feel as good if we had not touch rock bottom before, it would not have felt as rewarding if it was there since the very beginning.
sucky it up AM!
Funny the one time I played necro this patch was in offlane and we won xd
I mean you can MAC ban someone but I've never heard of banning someones mobo.  How would they even go about doing that?
I guess you are right about people who missed the original. Post didn't have that much when I commented on it. \n\nI'm not fan of a reposts of content that is not even week old.
Not a fan of a reposts of less that a week old content.
It doesnt look like cheat, probe me wrong if was a script but his mouse was focusing on Rubik and about to cast orchid on him when you jumped and it probably casted midair and it was just lucky. Also we dont know exact mouse positioning because of resolution and screen config not beign the same for everyone.\n\nEdit: second one, 100% script, enjoy 6 month ban hammer wr &gt;:D
can pigs effectively wear capes? :thinking:
Oddly enough outside of this subreddit people think SingSing is one of the better contestants. \n\nI think its the format of the show and the talking points that needs to be improved. 
yes
Is it possible to use orchid on someone without using your cursor? I don't think any keybind can do that, his cursor wasn't over Magnus when it happened. I'd say 100% cheating.
Jugg and AM are very different. AM always has been and always will be a pretty situational pick. If you want to spam 1 carry for 50 games, yeah, definitely go Jugg. But even with the bfury nerf AM is still quite strong.
Next step: remove replays and voice chat

nigga you gay
Simple rewards are great for player retention. Hope valve goes more towards this direction in creating a positive environment for us players in future. Perhaps a visible detailed commend log history would be nice. 
Resembles a lot of WK in that set
I want to play Undying more, but I my team never seems to do anything after 30 minutes.
what is with all this gay shit
It's funny how Valve is getting praised for features that should have been there in the first place. I wonder if they do it on purpose and leave out obvious features to be 'improved' on later lol
That's a straight up lie
awful item, should have never been added to the game. same with solar crest and lotus orb. these items and other changes have been constnatly made to make solo pick offs harder and harder, making the game "faster" (teamfights from min 0 until the game ends patch lul)
 I agree with him tho Kappa 123
As a former necro main, after his rework, I just couldn't get back into him, which is funny cause I thought I would love to play him, but after his general stat changes, I can't get back into him.\n\nMaybe I just got good and into a somewhat decent mmr bracket where I can't go Veil-Greaves-Pipe every game.
bitcoin all ober again
They actually brought Sing Sing back for another episode after this first appearance.\n\nDo they hate their show?
Not really but why not buy a solar crest instead, use that on your target, ult to dispel your lack of evasion+armor, have your dazzle glimmer cape you then have a shallow grave to back you up at 1hp for your rampage as the other team jumps you as 5 from the trees? Huskars gold is better spent elsewhere.
Same thing with Invoker players . The loss of the exp talent has hit them hard
you know atleast he is still trying. and looking at the scoreboard, with a few more heroes they could possibly get a big comeback gold target.\n\n(im so pissed at this clip really)

a little suggesition: you need to make the show more 'legit', where the game and still fun t watch rather than bunch of people goofing around. replace slack with shane or someone
sighhh
I did, I said Fata would be great in the offlane. Now I just have to convince PPD to drop Pajkatt and pickup w33haa

I still disagree with  the implementation of Cooldown Reduction (However, KOTL's CDR is fine), Status Resistance (I'm ok with Grow and Aeon Disk, not it being normalized), spell amplification and mana cost reduction/mana loss reduction. No good reason, it just feels unnatural.
lol man, he could have just had a chainmail, and AM would have been doing almost the same damage (.83 armour from agi). Armour from greaves= armour from mek= armour from chainmail. He isn't stacked with defensive items, but meh, reddits dumb sometimes

not for physical labour ... weird
Yeah, I understand that. It's been really great so far, but with episode 3, there was a lot of arguing between the points and the rules and format. Can't blame them, it seems a little flexible, which is completely fine, but when you have people that play dota 2 in the lineup, I'm sure it can be a little competitive.

That was a really poor play by DJ.\n\n\nThat was the only path he could have taken that had the risk of Slark catching him up (due to fog increasing his movespeed by quite a lot). He should have ran either west or east before the small camp so Slark couldn't get the movespeed advantage. Slark's base movespeed without fog is like 350, Kotol had +400ms.\n\n\nIt's good that DJ timed his Blinding Light accidentally on exactly correct time. With 0.2 seconds later he would have most likely died.
Yes, that's what FTD stands for :)
you’re just as retarded if you think all they did was work on the field

dont fucking bother\n\nvalve wont do something anyways\n\nhow many times my games were ruined cus of scriptkids
No it isn't. Think of a situation where your friend borrows his/her account to you and you play for him/her. \n\n1. Why would Valve use precious money-making-time to react to something like this?\n2. If Valve really did something like this, how would they react? They can't just ban ppl because they don't have any proof. The change of the ip address is not enough.
There are even websites how to increase your companies income by boosting others' clients\n
are u dumb? someone probably posted on ebay. will give mmr for 50 bucks. 
GGEZ
Well if this is the case, then I was wrong. I just don't understand why Valve would do it because it's compareable to smurfing.\n\nBtw, your argumenting skills are out of shape. Grow up a little before you start talking to people.
Yes it's definitely a script, reaction may be literally be humanly impossible. Especially that second one. Been seeing a lot of scripts lately especially on Tinker who auto casts all of his abilities and items instantly after rearm.

Ouch. So you’re not gonna be a comedian, at least we got that out of the way :)
So confused 
You know nothing then
&gt; it's compareable to smurfing\n\nthey added the phone nber verification to combat this. Sure, there are work arounds, but they are against this as well.\n\n&gt; Grow up a little before talking to people\n\nKnow what you're talking about before speaking.\n\n
Mushi has a gf? PepeHands :gun:
Darude - Sandstorm.
congrats!!!
Hope they party on stream on a regular basis.
you people need help
To be fair, he never said anything about spying.\n\nI can imagine sending a slave over to someones house to ask a question would happen wouldn't it? This is just a guess, mind you.\n\nI think that would count as finding information.\n\nEDIT: Although I have no idea why the conversation was brought up in the first place. Was a very strange comment.\n\nEDIT2: Actually it doesn't even need to be someone else's house. It could just be sending one slave to ask another slave a question.

Well, feeder ice formed 100% of Mineski's deaths in game 1 Kappa
Is roam alch finally good now? His stun is kinda insane and he gets so much from picking bounties, can even steal enemy bounty with his stun easily. But what are you doing at lvl 1 ?
the fuck did i just watch?

I understand this thanks to Meme review Clap Clap
And why are u posting a play from 4 fucking years ago?
No it wouldn't happen. Slaves were held hostage, if they could go to someone's house, they would run away.

Me_irl when someone bitches about no miss call... like damn how hard can it be to last hit in a free lane and watch your minimap
Our darling savior from esl, RawDota, has an entire YouTube series where he does exactly the same thing. It's called "escaping the trench".
*can*? Yes. But *would they*?
&gt;Slaves were held hostage\n\nAll of them?\n\nI have heard of instances where the "masters" were fairly lenient with them. Again I may be wrong. This is just from what I have heard.\n\n&gt;if they could go to someone's house, they would run away\n\nWhere to?\n\nI imagine if you saw a black person roaming around back then, you would automatically assume they were a slave and ask who they belong to. [Doesn't sound like they had much incentive to try to run.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_slaves_in_the_United_States)\n\nEDIT: Example of lenient owner:\n\n&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephaniah_Kingsley\n\nSounds like he would let them run tasks like that.\n\nEDIT2: Just to be clear, I am not trying to paint this as "slaves didn't have it so bad". This is obviously not true. They were fucked. My only point is that there probably were a small handful who did run small tasks in order to "find information".
even that combo can't save EE though.... 
Or just having money, girls want money
It's like you don't know what greaves do
Can't you blink out of Atos?
this literally unplayable meme has to stop it isnt even funny 
not really, slaves are typically enslaved on a mental level, grinded into their subconscious  that they can't even hope to be something else\n\nthey wouldn't even be able to think of running away or to rebel against their master
free gaem
Why tf are people downvoting you when what you are saying is accurate. If before the small camp he went left or right, he would have still escaped, but it would have been much safer. \n\nEdit: East is by far the safest way, with west being a bit worse. \n
Never let euros reddit.
he know it all thats why he is the pro and DJ is not.

Lol, it gave him mana which allowed AM to burn him down again anyway, so it gave him armour and about 100 health in the end\n\n"Stacked defensive items" lol. Its funny you're so condescending but your comments are so dumb. Like in the first place you said he stacked defensive item*s*, when he has literally got 1 defensive item, then your like "Greaves" when he only got it at the end and it did nothing, but you don't seem to understand that
Is that a UI mod?
No doubt he tries hard and evaluates his play fairly, you don't get to be good otherwise. I would however, just based on the instances where he tryhards in pubs, expect him to proactively communicate a fair bit more than Bulldog (calling some shots etc.), who really goes to the bare minimum when trying hard.
booy he did not see that comming.
yes yo gei
&gt;Btw, your argumenting skills are out of shape\n\nOh shit the classic reddit line, damn that's a nuclear burn right there
I miss the old HUD :(\n\n&gt; Downvote only if off-topic or factually wrong, NOT if you disagree.  \n
Tbf is someone is not watching map, they wont read the chat either.
Except the Slark activated ulti and Kotol kept going to fog after the ulti expired - giving Slark more time to run in fog with increased movespeed, ALMOST catching up to Kotl. When Kotl simply could have chosen a path where Slark get's no movespeed bonus from fog. Even if the path to his ally is longer, the risk is far smaller.

Active ability: Invincibility\n\nAfter a 0.6 second delay, grants invincibility and 45% magic resistance to you or a target allied unit for 5 seconds if average mmr of the game is less than 5k.
Slark wasting his ult like that was a perfect chance to kill him and even if slark managed to catch up, theres still blinding light as an incurance, that ability is not to be underestimated during day light.\nYou can choose from super safe route or a possible net gain.\n

&gt; \n&gt; \n\nI'm 12 BTW and 'craving for literrary nips made me giggle'
What do you mean accidentally? Look at his abilities his ult was off-cd it wasn't by accident. Slark was no way gonna kill kotl at that moment.
&gt; argumenting \n\nnice word xD
Today is patch day.
Why do you even bother reporting things to valve employees when they don't have a department that handles cheating/game behavior? Boosters are the smallest problem our community has and the chance to get a booster on your or enemy team is 50/50 + you can learn something from playing with a or against a player with higher skill level. Valve completely trashed the low competitive tier dota and gives absolutely no rewards to players that are trying to become pro or to sustain themselves while dedicating themselves to dota. AND before people begin white knighting valve, i've been an admin at dotalicious, i've seen some of my friends become pro and know through what they have been to get there.
Downvote this fuck.

Ok downvoted this fuck ^
you can go ahead and thank the report system for that.
i couldnt care less if you downvote me end of the day its just a website and this meme is getting old and unfunny, ill admit though  it was pretty funny at first but now its just getting out of hand every small thing and now everyones gotta put literally unplayable this literally unplayable that in the title its a little over doing it if you ask me. just my 2 cents.
Yeah I've muted all chat recently. But sometimes I really want to pass on some message but then realize I can't.\nI then use chat wheel
You mean because if chat ban?
Reported 2 times still
Mineski really had an easy route because Fnatic are in the lower bracket. These two teams are 5-5 since Abed has joined. 
He is just too good
i was in that game, rly anoying thing just ban this mothafucka

Came here for techies, was disappointed
Music is shite.
I have never been more embarrassed of playing video games than this moment. \n
So Valve actually took lessons from LoL cooperation with Imagine Dragons\n\nFor those who is out of loop: [Imagine Dragons: Warriors | Worlds 2014 - League of Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmI_Ndrxy14)  
This sucks
Valve forgot to make it good though.
TF is that shit? 
"The best". That's like winning the tallest midget contest.
Wrong title. \n\nPangolier dodges BSJ tp channeling.
This is weird as fuck, but is nice too get new content.
Ummm whaat? One of Valve employee fan gaying anime shit now? 
Then don't buy it?
Divine rank players
This is fucking gay.
Yet another sign of how out of touch Valve is.
Greatly animated but... what is this
I really wish they went a different route with this.\n\nI think teaming up with popular musicians and working on a music videos can be done, and can even be done really well. [The jinx music video is an example of that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs)\n\nI just don't think it was done correctly in this instance. Watching it, it didn't feel like it had anything to do with dota;\n\n* Its set in a bar (there are no bars in dota).\n\n* The characters don't act in a way that I would expect them to act based not only on lore but just how they look.\n\n* There is barely anything in this video hints towards gameplay at all (A video using dota 2 assets, you would expect to see this).\n\nI think I understand why this was made. Valve work with them in the hopes that they can reach a new audience but its just a trash video. I think even that new audience would think the same thing. SFM doesn't provide you with super high quality animation (or at least not in this video). If I heard that Valve were doing this I would expect the same animation quality we saw from the [TI animations.](https://youtu.be/d6H-HEpnlk8?t=2m11s)\n\nEDIT: Valve actually have nothing to do with this apparently. SFM is 100% free use according to /u/co0kiez\n\n
“People aren’t allowed to express their opinion” fuck off 
&gt;AWOLNATION\n\nMore like ABOMINATION
It's just silly to comment about how well it fits with Dota 2 when A. it's something that only the person using it sees, and B. it's MUSIC. Do you often mention how much the music someone is listening to while playing doesn't fit Dota? 
lmfao r u retarded nigga
My point is that whether or not a music pack goes with Dota is irrelevant to whether or not it should be in Dota, or even whether there is something "wrong" with it. It's pointless to even mention that it doesn't "fit" with Dota.
&gt;Some people really value having consistent themes in the games they play. It's fine if you don't. I don't. The other guy clearly doesn't\n\nBecause that is irrelevant for something that ONLY THE PERSON USING IT SEES/HEARS. This isn't a skin. It's a music pack that you never have to see or hear or acknowledge in any way if you aren't the one who bought it.\n\n&gt;No-ones opinion is irrelevant.\n\nYes, opinions can be irrelevant. 
meh
They must have approved it though right?\n\nIf they are profiting from the video?\n\nAnd posted it to the blog? (maybe less of an indicator)\n\nI haven't read up on how the rights for SFM works so I might be wrong. SFM might be 100% free use. I have no idea.
dunno, this hammer did almost nothing xD\n
The bar isn't in-game. That's the only thing I care about. \n\nI shouldn't have to go out of my way to find information on this. If I play dota. I won't see the bar unless I read the comics.\n\nI can take a guess and say that the people who read the comics are the minority of the playerbase.\n\nEDIT: OK, I am getting a lot of flak for this for whatever reason. Let me lay this out in a way that is a bit less blunt (copy/pasted from comment further down in the chain).\n\nI am saying that if most people aren't familar with the tavern in dota 2, then you probably shouldn't feature it in any promotional material for it because:\n\n* a) It's not going to be easily recognisable for most people who play the game. There are going to be a minority who do.\n\n* b) For those that don't play the game and get drawn in by the video, there is the possibility for confusion. \n\n"Where is the tavern I saw in the video" \n\n"Oh its not in the game, its in the lore"\n\nI don't think this is a very controversial position.
&gt;I chose not to take many creative liberties from the original live-action video and follow its action as close as I could\n\nI guess this is just the thing I disagree with the most. I just wish the narrative was focused more towards the game and less towards the original video.\n\n&gt;unfortunately with up to 13 characters to animate all by myself over 3+ minutes\n\nIf this is how it was then that makes it more understandable though.\n\n&gt; In my opinion you want people to not be thinking about mechanics at all\n\nNot so much about mechanics but how the characters might interact with eachother in-game. The film-maker contest entry about bane's nightmare spell, for example.\n\nThese are all going to be opinion based arguments though so I don't know how much we will agree on.\n\nEDIT: Also [I addressed the comic thing here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7w8ijn/musical_melee_at_the_sundered_moon/dtyjca8/) Albeit rather bluntly.\n\nEDIT2: I apologise if it came across as though I were insulting your work btw. I didn't mean to do so with that comment. If I remember who you are correctly, I am pretty certain you have done some fantastic stuff.\n\nThe stuff I have been comparing this video to has been Valve produced cinamatics which I now realise was probably not the right thing to do as I have since been told that Valve had no part in this.
They have a gem though..........................
This is not right.\nRiki should go out of invis when channeling meteor.
Is... this.. a shitpost..? \n\n\nBut it was published in the Dota 2 official page... why...
awful, would have been better to just not make this\n\nalso; holy FUCK music today is bad
&gt;justify you not knowing something\n\nHow am I justifying not knowing it? (I want an actual answer to this btw)\n\nI am saying that if most people aren't familar with the tavern in dota 2, then you probably shouldn't feature it in any promotional material for it because:\n\n* a) It's not going to be easily recognisable for most people who play the game. There are going to be a minority who do.\n\n* b) For those that don't play the game and get drawn in by the video, there is the possibility for confusion. \n\n"Where is the tavern I saw in the video" \n\n"Oh its not in the game, its in the lore"\n\nI don't think this is a very controversial position.
its pretty obvious. EG is the only good team from NA. it was an ez run, but just had to make the post cuz its a what u do when someone qualifies lol
Just let me know when someone makes a video of Lina, instead of punching, she is shooting flames outta her pussy and ulting people with lasers from her tits. Make my dream happen no kappa
you're really defending this forced falsetto garbage? listening to this singer is like listening to people scratching a chalkboard with a knife. the lyrics are meaningless and random outside of the rhyme scheme and pentameter. Unless i am missing something more significant than the surface level, tired reference to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, this is a song that is essentially about nothing at all, like most modern music (especially alternative, unfortunately). \n\nthe rustic scene does nothing to offset the pretension of these lazy, accessibly inaccessible lyrics and continues the alternative-mainstream target shopper trend that has infected popular music and was really set off with sounds like "Imagine Dragons." My argument is that the modern era of music is a faux-intellectual nonsense that reflects the lack of authentic experience the most recent generation has. Music like this doesn't arise out of a culture, music like this is a commercialized alternative that eclipses real artists and is generated by people like Max Martin who killed music in the 1990s and has kept his foot on the casket since then.\n\nI hope that you can develop less patience for this corporate garbage and take a stand against our culture's musical death
That some Ultra Instinct shit right there.
i think a lot of people suggested it not sure. but you may have been the first.
Col choked
The song was awful. You have to have some very niche tastes if you think they chose something good.
The visual effect at the target area during the channeling is visible to allies only.\n\n\nThe visual effect around the caster is visible to everyone who has vision on the caster.\n\nShould be changed? Nerf inc?
Too late, get out please.
The warriors one is cancerous enough for both games.
Nice video, shame the game is still utter dog shit thanks to the last big patch
They should have removed that shit taunt
This post is funny though.

Amazing how such a top tier team like Complexity is unable to qualify through the NA qualifiers. Really shows how strong, challenging and competitive the region is. Truly remarkable.

That was 33 wasn't it?  Sing's boy?
Nice to see CCnC break his curse and go to a Major Dota event! He played really well game 2(w/ ratting DP) and game 3(amazing puck)! GL to them!
Yea, ever since he left MoF he has become a beast. Well Played to w33ha!
NA salt
Don't think many people are shitting on the video (or the fact that he probably got paid big for it) at all. It's more that no one likes AWOLNATION or their part of the video. Personally I think Max did as good of a job as he could have given the source material and commissioned project, I just think AWOLNATION is garbage so seeing them sort buy promotion in a game I love feels gross (especially being promoted by Valve). But hey, I don't gotta buy and listen to it so whatever.
FeelsWeirdMan
I'm a huge OpTic fan. Bias aside, it seems like they are becoming a tier 1.5 team.
Is Valve seriously not doing anything about the Galaxy Battles 2 Major?

I have seen short films that have way better content than this promotional video. They could have hired one of the content creators from SFM, because this was so brainlessly executed. Most of the song was just characters sitting and staring. And it makes no sense that dota 2 heroes not using abilities in fights and are punching each other...
NA got two spots.\n\nEU runners up would pretty easily beat the clown fiesta NA team that gets through.
Yes, characters taken from SFM walking and sitting and moving their lips while camera is still. SFM animation 2018! Wow!

I don't really like it tbh, now if a tyler bates composed a music pack and was released for dota 2....\n\nTAKE MY GOD DAMN MONEY\n\n-----------------\n\nThe reason I don't like awolnation is because they rely too much on musical composition vs putting work into musical lyrics, If there is any one that is sorta like that genre I like it would be woodkid, overall pop music doesn't have allot of good music in it, what I mean by that is music theory.\n

I don't doubt though. There was a point where Arteezy said on stream that they were KappaPride for each other.
Rotk is coaching. Not drafting. 
AFAIK coaches are not allowed in booths, right?
poor LFY still got rekt even with addition of Ohaiyo\nFnatic on the other hand... (they got outplayEEd)

hey again ! man you really have a problem with logic and confirmation bias dont you xD  \n\nIf you dont care about this bar because it is not on the dota map regardless of it being in the lore and you being able to read the comics  in the client,  then what about the fucking multitudes of locations shown in LoL videos that are not in the LoL map ??!!  jesus christ dude.   \nValve are not a near - pixar level animation studio  like RioT are , and LoL is much larger  / profitable than dota. \nSure valve could do a WHOLE lot more with the millions we give em , and with icefrog's recent commitment it seems they are headed in the right direction.    \nAgreed that it is just a bad video. It is shot for shot of the original video done by a single guy so not much to work with.    \nSent u a reddit chat .

Can’t wait for EE to retire so I can’t stop watching his shit drafts. All these years of playing and he still does the same garbage... 
We change Ohaiyo for Universe to have a better chance to win TI. Get EEliminated at Qualifier. /s
All of these short calls from fnatic are so freaking bad. And what the hell with that razor first pick in every draft. Their drafts become predictable. 
Fuck roster lock. Play in the open qualifiers since there is no way they are going to be invited again. Kick the problEEm.
First pick razor and not banning Omni omegalul. Seriously bad shot calling too. And I’m an Envy fan 
Ohaiyo died for this
Still fnatic gave this EE the power to kick ohaiyo EleGiggle
Disband plz or kick envy or leave him in the airport.
Well dota doesnt use true random on anything but uphill miss chance (as far as im aware), so its more like 5-10-15-20-25 etc.\n
What the fuck.\n\nI was studying after game 1 since my boy TNC lose.\n\nDidn’t expect this to happen

Justice for Ohaiyo. lol
flair checks out like no flair ever checked out before
They did
Fnatic pizza party inc!!!
0-6 garbagEE
That was a little sloppy but the team is slowly getting there. Gg TNC.
~~Ohaiyo~~ 1437 is the problem.
So sweet seeing Fnatic getting eliminated.
GG TNC Kuku drafted this series great after they got brooded in game 1.\n\nStill more qualifiers to come hoping for Mineski vs Fnatic next qualfiers since I think TNC always played badly against Mineski.
lmao where u at EE fangays?
FUCK YOU UNIVERSE.\n\nSo glad they lost .\n\nToo bad Big God lost too :/
thats two games back to back 0 kills on a pos1...
EE always backs his teams into corners with his drafts.\n\nDraft for split and just pick teamfight after teamfight? WutFace
"TNC NEEDS A WESTERN CAPTAIN TO QUALIFY FOR ANYTHING, ALL FILIPINO TEAM WON'T WORK" -REDDITORS What now? SoBayed?
Most of the time it's really painful to be an EE fan... Why am I doing this to myself
sad.
Abed has not been doing great lately. He becomes way too cocky and overconfident. There were so many games that he was caught out of position which costed them the game. I don't know why he become like this. When he first joined fnatic, he played way better than this 
Plenty of suckers keep cheering for him, so he's full on Na'vi effected\n\nHe could litterally int feed down mid (I know he kind of already does, but still) and 30% of leddit will cheer for him.\n\nEksdee gimme those salty downvotes
Yea winning against a tier 3 fnatic doesn't mean much. Maybe let them get top 4 in a LAN then you tag me okay?
cause he still in pro team\n\nseriously he played so bad last game
hope for Miracle-
What'd Universe do to piss you off?
Damn. Fnatic is lacking a good carry. 
the only thing he's adamant is in getting pie as his teammate\n\nThere's not many captains that inst pos5, and pie cant captain for shit. \n\nEE's forced to captain all his teams because none of his teammates for the past 5years except puppey wanted to captain for longer than 2months.
Im stil here :(
Who is that Canadian player for Fnatic? He should go back to NAlulz region. Razor pos5 new meta OMEGALULZ
:))
Jesus what a shit draft.\n\nFirst pick razor when EE so trash at it\n\nLion into omni naga\n\nTinker into naga distruptor\n\nRANT EDIT: I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY HE EVEN PICK RAZOR HE HAS BEEN SHIT AT THE HERO SINCE NP 2016. IF YOU WANT TO 1st PICK CORE GO PICK SOMETHING YOU CAN PLAY FFS
Nahh, Fnatic is just bad. They even lost to team BOOMID lol.
Its ebonics, dont be racist (/s on the racist part)
envy can only play Razor and TB now   
also denying eidolons and treants with the other eidolons/treants Kreygasm
and a good drafter
well even not with full 5 pinoy they din get much achievement either what r u sayin
that's a permaban\n
They were mutually exclusive comments. Razor is not a hard carry, not in a position where it’s worth first picking. \n\nThey got owned by Omni last game and let it through, even if it’s countered by razor it’s still a strong pick in the current meta. Not like it’s gg razor got picked. 
I think so too. I also dont know why They dont Pick terrorblade anymore. From like 20 games with Tb they only lost game 3 vs vici at the minor. EE had like 800gpm this game and abed died twice in two minuits without bb on his voker and lost the game. 
they qualified on the lower bracket in one of the weakest regions. tbh from sea right now i only see mineski as a legitimate threat in a lan environment.
W33 carried that Finals though, not EE. Plus it's Puppey calling shots (captain).
Honestly Fnatic display better than LFY\nLFY pure trash
Big God 2 and Fnatic got eliminated today.\n\nWhat a beautiful day it is. 
I agree. EE so bad as a carry/captain. He's attitude is at worst as well, much better for him to retire right now, and just watch dumb animes at home. Fnatic deserves better carry
Oh yeah dude cool story you totally just like him ironically Hahaa\n\nSee it's all a joke we're not seriously cheering for him :)\n\nSome Dean Takahashi stuff in here
It's EE ofc. Whenever a dumb move happened it will and will always be EE Krappa
No, he just joined Secret to fuck them over when they were good
Trashing pro players only makes you look dumb as your'e garbage compared to him. Its like making fun of yourself. What an idiot.
Yes but dota doesnt have true random most of the time.
/u/l3ef0re_Time has a point tbh.. Look bruh. TNC with demon, gets them to TI6, beating OG. AND 1437 brings TNC to TI7 aswell (top 10).  \nI think he's pointing out that TNC will be so much better with a better captain and drafter like Demon and 1437.  \nAlso for this qualifiers, they did not even beat Mineski ffs.
Fnatic should learn from Team Liquid on not to draft the same hero twice in a series especially if it's a core. Razor might not be a bad hero but he was pretty much neglected in the last two games. Props to Kuku for outdrafting them. kinda felt bad for DJ tho.  
My god this thread is toxic. Fnatic lost 2-1. It wasn't even that bad. 
please point on the doll where EE touched you
the last game was pretty bad. bad draft and bad playstyle.
How much bet did you lose EE dick sucker?? rofl
SEA fans really hate each others teams. \n\nEdit - thanks she2k14 , didnt realize I worded it wrong
Back when TNC was a 5-man pinoy lineup with ryOyr they also qualified to multiple tournaments but choked and placed poorly in everything. So let's not jump to conclusion when they can't even touch mineski and only beat a rather shaky Fnatic right now. 
Hating and shitting on envy are becoming new kind of entertainment for this sub now LUL
SEA is extremely toxic and I hope everyone around the world realize this by now. Pub games are basically all these flamings you see here. 
Think that's the joke mate
What's the most popular? 
Oh, so when my cores say IDC game they mean they're gonna play like they're at TI? Weird, even when trying their best I think bulldog subs can beat them
But Secret didnt knew at that time how shitty Universe will turn out to be 
So what has 5-man pinoy TNC accomplish? A WESG win? That's it?? 
1. Yeah, but EE can't play Razor so whats the point.\n\n2. DJ aint doing shit as a Chen early game. He babysit EE instead. \n\n3. Yeah that FB is so stupid. Whats Abed doing there ffs. TNC supports punish over extension like that.\n\n4. Draft IS bad. Letting Disruptor through after Omni Naga pick is bad. Are Fnatic sleeping on the last 2 tournaments or something. Lion is a slow ass hero and TNC could sing/repel+GA/astral anybody get initiated by Lion. A pos 5 Lion needs to literally walk within 600-700 range of enemy hero while there rest of team do not really have a good catch besides landing UL root.\n\n5. Lion pick was so bad PLD has negative impact the whole game. He contributes absolutely nothing in laning phase due to mana problem and having attack and staying power of a wet paper. Disruptor  literally could cage him and Lion would die because he cant escape. The 3 CC + Ult is theoretically good at ganking but Fnatic has 0 burst or initiation catch to support it. That one smoke where they killed naga literally need 4 hero. Anyone missing and naga would probably sing out.
implying fnatic with their sorry excuse of a pos 1 carry and captain, has the option of mixing it up. Razor 3 times lul. that's how limited he is
In hindsight that Razor pick is most likely a deny pick as TNC knows how to play it and the times Fnatic up against Razor of any team they get demolished.\n\nIt is clear that EE has 0 idea how to play it and picking it first just open up so many opportunities to counter it, altho TNC ended up doing Newbee strat instead. It through and through questionable draft even before the questionable execution.
I guess because they don't know the write words to use so they would just plainly use those common profanities and everyday words that they can see in reddit.
every region is stacked right now barring SA. China is always stacked. EU is too. for CIS, VP/Navi are pretty decent right now despite the shuffle imo. only region comparable would probably be NA but i dont think anybody wants to underestimate EG. does that mean nobody is weak? or is weak relative to those who are on top? when i say SEA is one of the weakest regions it doesnt mean theyre below SA. i just cant see them winning tournaments with all of the t1 teams present. id also rate NA around SEA level.
Yeah. You are right. I guess dota becomes an outlet of frustrations in the SEA.
I lost it. :D
Psychological advantage you mean.\n\nNot mental, surely
HAHAHAHAA EE !!! 
This must be way back to their families by which they can express their frustrations to someone or something in some degrees. We have this rebellious nature and these reditors can express their frustrations through Reddit and EE. THank God we have EE to shit upon than drugs to rely into. EE is a blessing.
maybe learn to read. i said they are one of the weakest ( SA is probably the weakest). idk where people get this idea that NA is any weaker than sea. the gap in DPC points between mski and EG is just 15 right now. and fnatic with the 2nd most from SEA is built with a lot of NA players. id honestly consider SEA + NA + SA  the weaker regions with EU, CIS, China being the stronger half.
I'm not talking about the question but about state of things in dota.
Lol I would like to see tnc qualify ahead of fnatic after the ohaiyo kick. 
I think you have Puppey and EE to blame for that.\n\nThat Team Secret was flawed and put together poorly. Puppey and EE thought they could kick w33 and Misery right after winning Shanghai and bring in Arteezy and Universe and be even better. \nWell, it doesn't work like that. They didn't even think about how the pieces fit together and thought that just stacking talent would get them a free TI win.\n\nBut yeah, Universe was so shitty that he went back to EG and finished top 3 at TI6 while Secret flamed out in the first round?
me too :(
EE without his tb just feels so underwhelming. Seems like that's the only hero he can actually carry with 
i said one of the weakest. id agree SA is the weakest but id rate NA and SEA to be of similar standing. teams from those regions need a hail mary to win in a fully stacked tournament. \n\nand fyi on the new system the number of finals appearance you have doesnt count as much as the number of points you have (eg. secret having more points despite liquids better records) since the money and prestige is greatly skewed towards TI anyway. and fnatic which has the 2nd most points in SEA is comprised of 3 NA players.\n\nare you saying sea is a stronger region by comparison when they have CIS/EU/China above them?
Why is nobody talking about 1437. Oh!! I forgot!! 
is rtz the 7th gf?
You have no clue boy.\nSecret with w33 Misery was very good but they decided to bring Arteezy.\nUniverse was sent to Secret to destroy the team and comeback to EG.\nWas a shitty move from him with no intention of playing good dotes for secret.
EE is a good entertainer, but not a good player.
Jabz dicksucker, cant even qualify to TI LUL
Yeah, it actually almost made me watch the Chinese games, almost. 
EU\nsecret 4260 liquid 3510 \n\nCIS  vp 2700 navi 1110 \n\nCHINA nb 1725 vg 810 lgd 472 lfy 200\n\nNA eg 885 comp 135 90 ~1110\n\nSEA mski 900  tnc 270  fnatic 390 ~1560\n\nso yes. the rest crossed the 3k mark with EU even crossing the 7k mark not even counting the obscure teams like kinguin (even forgot to count OG here). while both NA and SEA are just half or a bit below of what China has at around ~3k. or do you and the rest of the downvote happy redditors want to keep pointing me to the 'facts'? \n
Why all Filipino team in one bracket, 
Universe with PPD: PogChamp\n\nUniverse without PPD: OmegaLUL
What sorcery is this?
jesus christ you better shut the fuck up,i always see you hating on ph teams on every thread i see you.. I remember you had a mineski flair then they lost a qualifier then you took the flair off while crying like a baby on reddit.\n\nalso back when tnc was a 5-man pinoy lineup they reached 3-4th at  starLadder i-League starSeries season 3 and during kiev they were 2nd at the group stages so that's not choking at everything you tard.
All I can say is that you're delusional. \n\nWhat kind of pro-player would intentionally leave a team like EG that would have had a guaranteed invite to TI to join another team just to ruin that team's chances. Intentionally ruining your own chances to compete at TI is illogical.
No, they should be called the Memey Ducks.
At least, it still better than EE BB and EE LC LUL
slow boring song, nothing happening for 2mins. SeemsGood
everytime i watch EE plays it's either razor or TB as the carry you ban those 2 heroes and EE will play on full retard mode
He's the senior wife.
https://i.imgur.com/JvIG9tX.png
So meta
Yeah I know about that one, I think I also argued with him one time when Mineski lost to Secret. 
HYPERBRUH
EU and CIS are so boring. EU is predictable and CIS is just plain bad
Prediction: OG is going to destroy final tribe in under 30 minutes total game time. OG and EG are tier 1 teams who do not belong on qualifiers with the likes of other disgusting tier 2/3 teams. Tournament organizers need to understand this fact.\n\n**Do not mix tier 1 teams with disgusting tier 3 teams. It is unfair for everyone.**\n\n
Fuck Grant, wanted to go to Epicenter to watch live but now I'm not
My.comment does not state Mineski though. 
Sad life... how much anime EE gave u kid? LUL
Wow mad pinoy calm the fuck down dude. I know you're proud of your goddamn country but let the results speak for itself. You don't need to be this fucking mad because you're too blind to believe that pinoy squads + NA captain is actually the best combination for pinoy teams. Typical nationalist attitude.
LETS GOOOO
I guess I've been too much intoxicated by pinoys in SEA pubs. Perhaps you could tell your fellow pinoys to stop being cancerous. 
the /u/dolphin37 guy is a known idiot. just ignore in RES

Pretty sure live's going to be in Russian.
Optic could have won game 1 on two occasions. First CCnC let zai die for no reason and second if they won that fight near the end in CoLs base which honestly she should have but somehow Jug survived.
OMEGA LUL
Hm
I really like how Armel manages his hero pool. He like flashy mid heroes like puck, nevermore, ka'el. Now with kuku's experience. He has a great mentor as top tier soon mid laner.
No way they can cancel 3 majors. Right?
not like his other teammates had great kda lmao
So you know, spirit breaker’s bash is actually true random. It’s one of the only things in DotA that is. 
Some NA tier 2 team that EG a tier 1 team has on their radar... Don't get me wrong they probably won't place t4 but I think they are better than you give them credit for.
idk if you watched this series but the last two games was all because TNC had godlike warding, not because "TNC can smell blood!!11"
Me calm down? Rofl look at your goddamn toxic comment retard.
and a good captain
no breaky pls those constant fake hype is too much

sumail said that
no shit sherlock
Adding him to cm will do nothing. Hell just remain unpicked or played once for a meme. Hero needs some changes. Even something as small as +8 base dmg can push him into competitive viability. Forfeiting the early game isnt a good risk to take.\n\n
please gaben
Naw.
delet this\n\nNot the post, the hero.
sure\n\nright after they get nerfed to fucking oblivion
No. I don't want to play 70+ min games.  It takes the fun out of the game for both teams
ember is the one that should be deleted 
Lmao 
As much as I'd like to see him once in a rare occasion, adding him to CM might mean buffs eventually which is a price I'm not willing to pay.
&gt;useless\nNice joke man\n
I am not sure if this is serious or not but just in case -  it is pretty common to buy bkb vs disruptor.
I think he needs his rework before he makes his way into CM. Nobody wants to watch a painful and boring 2.5 hour game of Techie's high ground defence at the International.\n\nHe needs to be made more active in fights, and more active with the team, instead of just sitting back and getting lame kills.
Wow, this Deepfake technology is insane.
Very hot!
Please no.
why?
NO NO AND NO
heheHahaHah go fuck yourself.\n
I'd rather lose in 20 mins than 70

damn its all garbage

no
he dodged tornado pretty well. even tho it was unintentional lol
No. When they won TI the land mines did over 500 dmg. They nerfed the mines dmg after TI and halved the cd. Then the hero was reworked
No. When they won TI the land mines did over 500 dmg. They nerfed the mines dmg after TI and halved the cd. Then the hero was reworked\n
ur not properly using the search function then
woosh
just do it just pull the trigger, kill competitive
Hes banned from here, dont ever say that cursed name or you will be cursed too. 
He just needs to change his ultimate. His ultimate is lame and boring, and losing heroes without any warning is not a fun way to play.\n\nI think his ultimate needs to act more like a single shot artillery, something that does high damage from high range, perhaps a longish cooldown and maybe a slow. Who knows.\n\nHis red mines and stasis mines are fine, and his suicide squad was a great addition to the hero.
fir and forget full hp kills should not exist in dota. the hero needed reworked
No its not, be grateful theyre still in the game, theyre a meme and will always be, icefrog already knows that.
How about you mute him instead of acting like a pseudo-intellectual and telling everyone that he invented a word when you are not educated enough to understand the context and clearly want to grab some karma for something so shallow. I don't approve his behaviour, but I absolutely despise your poser attitude full of "like, literally" and such.
Nope, you're wrong. They did 450 damage on lvl 4, so u had to be at least lvl 7 to deal that damage. TI5 was played on 6.84c. Stop making land mines more OP than they were.\n\nSuicide, however, did 500 damage on lvl 1.
pls die
Yeah, it's really telling that this meme about Chinese being ahead in memes is always posted on every thread about Chinese and always highly upvoted. We just beat every meme to death. \n\ne: Okay, replace "Chinese" with "Asian". 
~~he got purged by razor passive, which removes x~~\n\nOops I was wrong
CR1T WYVERN LUL CR1T WYVERN LUL CR1T WYVERN LUL
More like time to delete that shit from the game. 
Except reddit, these techies loving fucks need to fuck off
I thought euls could purge the x
The issue is him claiming to be the greatest and best team then getting stomped like an international ranked match the next day.
Phoenix with eyes DansGame
your an idiot
Does anyone actually enjoy this music or is it just a meme at this point? 
How bout no. The Techies way of play is not fun for most people playing the game. Being scared to walk into a lane because you may die WITH NO WARNING is not fun.\n\nThe hero needs a complete design change. Leave Red mines, but change everytbing else about the hero needs a change so he is actually useful
No, fuck techies. Let him rot.
Fuckin dogshit pinoy players.
Christ save us

Funny how you circlejerk about this, once again proving reddit is full of people who can't think for themselves for once and eat everything up.\n\n\\&gt;muh idiots inventing new words lol so funny\n\n\\&gt;haha everyone look at him\n\nAnd then you complain about being flamed (for probably playing like a monkey) when you do exactly the same.\n\nBut hey, let's curse on each other and this will be something constructive!
You immediately shitposted and downvoted me. I hope a piano falls on you some day :)

Just a giant fucking ad at TI.
They did less damage but you could place them into huge overlapping piles.
yes, but in this case its true. fuck techies. 
Good example of a loud minority
ulol
lmfao
Op was an overstatement, I mean that they have strong blocking application
haHAA
Literally the only time EG picked Techies on Main Stage at TI5 they didn't pick tusk so you are wrong.
You are a son of a faggggggggggg

you do know that radiance can be clicked to disable? or are you telling me that you went diffusal travels before radiance and you want to surprise the enemy.
Honestly who cares it's Phoenix
The fact you thought it was pointed at you and only you after that shitty meme-like comment forces me to think this sub is even below the average person when it comes to reading. It is extremely sad this place is taken seriously by dota 2 devs.
Right because remote mines are SOOOO loud before they blow up
Yes, let's just drop 2k gold on sentries and not actually get items because of a single ability that could one shot you if you don't. Sounds like a balanced ability to me
0/10
Lol holy fuck youre bad at statistics. You must be on the left.. one game from one team doesn't mean shit, if anything it proves my point. If he was op without tusk, he would have been picked all the time without him but he wasn't. And i already went over why that game was a nonfactor. every time tusk was banned, techies was ignored, other than that one eg game. 
nice slideshow

i dont think sumail gives a fuck anymore. he made his money with ti and he knows eg wont kick him. as long as he doesnt become complete dumpster tier, he can do whatever he wants

HINDI NAG RESEARCH!!!!! ICE BA KUYA LON HAHAHAHA
If it's anything like his taste in music, you prolly don't want to see it.
Wait wouldnt it be cool if some item has effect even if we drop it? For example: radiance burn twice or thrice the damage to everyone even u and ur team when u drop it. Rapier deal 30% to 50% of ur max hp as damage when u pick it up? U have to channel with the item for 3-5 sec to successfully pick it up. Imagine losing a rosh fight but the enemy are too low and u dont want them to get the rosh so u drop ur radiance on the ground to prevent it. Gyro or dusa drop the rapier but the enemy cant pick it up because they are too low from split shot and flak cannon.
Up you go!
Yes Techies needs more nerfs.
Not all capes wear Liquid
radiance on Naga in 2018? Where's your meteor hammer bruh?
I questions the type of person one is when I see a techies picker
When you drop items close to the treeline they can end up in weird places. Something similar happened to Swindlez at TI5 when he famously dropped his Euls on Storm and it got deleted by ES.
Arteezy was against Zai in almost every game on this stream and they were all beautiful but rtz was also really outplaying zai in pretty much every situation across all the games.  I didn't realize there was such a difference in skill between them.
MODS! Ban this man!
well you cant make x-mark a debuff because then you can purge it off which you currently cant

go play WW in next match Crit-! and show them EG is still top tier team!
Hopefully valves reply...No
I completly forgot i ordered these. Pretty sweet looking.
They don't do nearly as much damage as a handful of mines stacked on each other. Especially late game. Getting ganked by a Lion with Finger at 12 minutes is not game ending. Losing two of your cores when trying to push at 50+ minutes is straight up game ending. That's why there are so many other people that share my opinion, or even simply want him removed from the game; he makes pushing impossible.

QoPs are losing all around. Anyone notice this as well?
Nando deserves a 6 month ban on that QOP
What were that decisions from Execration? Splitting farm and getting picked off around the map for past 5 minutes without trying to reclaim anything. These plays remind me of fnatEEc style LUL
I mean i can see it being maybe situational, he has movement and attack speed, just lacks the damage which bf gives. Yeah probably not in that situation, but so many builds were once considered shit tier unexpectedly bumped up to high priority. \n\nRadiance Manta Octarine Alch? Phase Urns Drums Spectre? Battlefury fuckin terrobrlade?
no surprise for a player like nando right there. 
i still think that mom/vlads into sny is better, helps you clear rosh sooner which is a ~1k networth swing in your teams favour, bf may only be better if your supports are stacking your jungle
Potential to feed gold to the entire enemy team vs a large area skill almost guaranteed to reveal the item's location plus which also disables potential enemy item thiefs? Really?
classic Exe. they dont even have Karl at mid atm. throw after throw lol
Only unsolved case is how to crack virginity lol
they arent fire and forget, there is a whole game of dota before oneshot power and you have interesting counter olay option (rather than "buy gem and stand still hitting/quelling mines for a long time)\n\nbut w/ever man you're clearly gonna read what you want in what i say
How does ninjaboogie have 23 assists on only 20 team kills? mind = blown
nando is like a type of mid player you see on pub game good on early stage but likes to go solo and instantly die on mid to late game
Techies is fine in pubs but in competitive nah, it ruins the game for me. What it becomes is a 3d minesweeper. Its not fun to watch.

Linkens against Drow (0 targeted spells), Lich (overkill against his targeted spells), Tide (overkill against his targeted spells), Jakiro (0 targeted spells) and SF (0 targeted spells)?
it's more for the split second of strong dispel so you can counter initiate using black holes or song
Anyone kicking ddc is crazy in my mind. The guy is a god, but still underrated as fuck.
"shares dotabuff game", This is the in-game client you idiot.

Mineski with the better late game decisions
iceiceice support nyx with lowest networth in Mineski
viper's impact is relatively low in ultra late games
Arguably the best what now? 
dude... you already reverted your flair when mineski was on a slump and this is only game 1. He's clearly saying that TnC is up there.
You mean buy? Dude has it pirated for sure.
The real space creator
Well even if it can't be dispelled, it is still only a 2.5s "ethereal" that also block magic and pure dmg. It doesn't prevent cc. If the nullifier owner gonna use the active to dispell combo breaker in order to kill you during a team fight instead of stopping your core using bkb, you can't really call it underwhelming.\n\nIt is all about the trade off.
Nullifier mutes items. Not that underwhelming because it's 4700 gold item vs 3350 gold item. 
Yeah. I wasn't interested in the other content so I added value by correcting the name of a person which was misspelled by OP.

Do you understand the word "arguably"? He might have posted that TNC was styling on Mineski yet TNC lost but he said arguably, so he isn't wrong on that part. If he said, TNC is the best team in SEA, then he dealt in absolutes and may have been wrong in that statement. 
Why did you say 'freaking' instead of 'fucking'…?\n\nJust interested to know.
Mineski ruined the swap by banning Nyx. Boo!
Agreed
You're such a fucking pro, can i suck your dick?
&gt; which was
/u/billgatesownerofwindowsOS LUL
What I said is correct.\n\n'Who was' would've been wrong. You can PM me if you need English coaching lessons. 
Meanwhile VG is looking amazing vs NB. granted, they have that annoying lycan
They should just install Gentoo.
&gt; I'd surely love to watch a pro game with techies would be hilarious asf.\n\nAbsolutely! But I would only want to watch one, ever. 
moon is such a bad laner 
 Was watching Ori's player perspective and got surprised that he is playing with minimap on the right side.\n\n\nDid he come from LoL or some other game?
And the exact opposite is when you pull something from your ass ! Like you just did now . Swindles dropped it right in front of him and instantly got stunned
something something they look like shit
Yuor'e wraung . Im riet
Does VG have an addiction to playing balls to the wall every game? \n\nAnyway, Ori best SF world.
I'm going to say this again, TNC are so bad at rosh fights. They get outplayed every time.
nigga u dumb\n\n-valve
Techies games are the only reason I've ever considered quitting dota. Please remove techies from the game entirely. They are a joke that's gone on long enough tbh.
Your point lol?
mineski literally just teamfought to win smh...
Iceiceice's fangays are just as lame as EE's fangays. Both never achieved anything while being a captain. E: Downvote me all you want because the truth does hurt.
nope ._.
It's not, Zai is notoriously bad pubber. He just doesn't really tryhard.\n\nI think back when he was still in Secret he couldn't even reach 6k for a while while top mmr was like 8k, and back then Zai for sure among most skilled pros. \n\n
And?
they won near rosh pit clash against fnatic in game 2 dac qualifiers well if that's considered a 'rosh fight'
0 impact from SamH the past 2 games, I think TNC should've kicked him instead  of 1437 and moved Kuku to pos 3.
Blind LUL
Well, he is probably the last relevant Singaporean dota player left. They have to have someone to fangay about I guess
Winter is the problem tbh.
where are you from ts?
Winter is the coach of Faceless before and FL is strong against SEA teams, they're the gatekeeper but they're completely shit most of the time outside SEA.
man i actually also think that samh kinda underperforms as a pos3 except when playing with his heroes like bat or sk. They kinda need a more versatile pos3 same with tims. He is still kinda ok but compare him with dj and jabz he is lackluster.
Winter is never their coach. He's been their consultant since the day this Mineski was formed. Before 71 came to the rescue, they officially had no coach after Solace left the team- From Mineski's staff.
kind of like fnatic with xcalibur last year lol
Shadow Dance. Nice true sight, kid.
Think there's a very good chance this is a pattern that emerged after a 16 year-old won ti with his first name as ign.
EG still not top tier?
hope Admiral wins against TNC this time..   
Google
its not happening man
You're the one who's been spewing bullshit since the day Faceless unable to attend the Ti7. He was the coach of Faceless but never the coach of Mineski. Give me the link to his interview pls? His most recent interview was 7 months ago. Malaysia is so small. Seen them and even talked to them face to face. I even played with them during Garena days. He's their consultant of course he would be there. He's not their fucking coach. Their coach was solace, and they had no replacement until 71 came to take over, although it's just temporary. Don't worry, I had the same thought as well. I really thought he was the coach of Mineski until I asked the staff himself.
le support circlejerk lelel xD
DAE support life is hard xDDD
Not really.\n\nKeep them out.
Allready top 8 
And he is also building blademail with the broadsword. gg noob learn dota
My university getting mentioned in r/dota2.\n\n\nDid not expect that
I refuse to believe Zai would ever struggle to get 6k.
https://steamdb.info/linux/\n\nIt's less than 50% for me and most of it is humble bundle junk. And many windows-only games are playable on Wine anyway; even Overwatch. And they can still dualboot or r/VFIO\n\nNot to mention many Dota players don't know about other games.
hi vishnu. i like indian gurls. shoow me ur peniz plz

Lifestealer assimilate.\n\nThe target does not take damage until it leaves Lifestealer, so it will eternally remain in a limbo state (dies if it leaves, stays alive if it stays inside). [](/techiesface)
Ok rape u next week
Yep
Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Meme Review
Somehow they manage to fuck those who watch the tournament online (facebook as streaming platform) **AND** those who watch it LIVE.\n\nA big clap for ESL LMAO
It takes a special kind of stupid to fuck it up this bad
The second is also following this logic where the team has like 33 kills but over 61 assists. I mean the enemy may die to creeps or tower but the difference is usually really big. I mean... enemy dying to creeps/towers happens like what... once maybe twice a game tops?\n\nEdit: I do not get why am I being downvoted for pointing out that in both scenarios assists are about 2x the kills. Most matches follow this proportion.
its official now. these guys hate the dota community. like atleast have the first quarterfinal played live too... that would make it 5 series LIVE. yes its not much but still something atleast. or have 4 quarterfinals atleast. fuck esl these guys continue to impress with their hatred towards the dota community. #FuckESL
How does it feel to believe in fictional characters like allan and jebus?
well, the fault is not only on ESL if the owner of the stadium/arena gave it to them for only 2 days
None of those skills are comparable to Techies mines, and you know it. I don't know why you're adamant to dissuade me of my personal opinion.\n\nRequiem has a 1.2-second cast point and requires Shadow Fiend to be on top of the target hero for the duration, either by a ~2500 gold Euls or an accompanying ally to stun. The total damage possibly dealt is 5152 magical damage, with an Aghanim's and 46 souls, and if the target continues to stay still for the duration of the spell. Also Shadow Fiend has to be directly on the hero during the spell, putting himself at risk to be there.\n\nLugana Blade deals ~640 pure damage, with a level 3 ultimate, which requires Lina to be level 18. With Aghanims, Laguna Blade deals 850 pure damage. At level 18, the hero with the second lowest possible health pool is Enchantress (Medusa has Mana Shield). At level 18, Enchantress has a total of 962 health, which is still high enough to survive a single Laguna Blade attack. Not to mention Lina has to be present in the fight to use it.\n\nLion's Finger of Death deals 1125 magical damage, with both an Aghanim's Scepter and his level 15 talent. After reductions, this comes to ~845 pure damage, which is comparable to Lina's Laguna Blade. The same argument can be found above. Lion also has to be present in the fight in order to deal the damage.\n\nIn comparison, Techies needs two remote mines to deal 900 pure damage, slightly more than both Lina and Lion. If techies has five mines, he can deal 3000 magical damage, or 2250 pure damage, which is enough to instantly kill Centaur Warrunner, the hero with the high health pool of 2122 at level 18. Not to mention, he doesn't have to be present and risk his life, and he can even do it while dead. 5 heroes dead, and it's still not safe to push high ground.\n\nYes, the mines can be countered by True Sight. However, it's completely impractical to line the length of every lane with sentries. A gem solves that issue, but with generally only one gem per team, there can't be a support with a gem following every core around all game, nor can cores normally be carrying the gem due to item slot restrictions. Zeus is fine counter to Techies, his lightning bolt can be spammed quite a lot late game with proper mana regeneration, and Void I suppose, if you really want to blow your Chronosphere just to destroy mines lol. Necronomicon 3 can also be used, but spending 5000 gold just to destroy mines seems impractical.\n\nHowever, all of this is irrelevant if Techies has an Aghanim's Scepter. Not only does he only need four mines instead of five to kill the same Centaur Warrunner, but his Minefield Sign means that his stacks of mines are completely uncounterable (correct me if I'm wrong). They cannot be seen with True Sight, and it would be impossible to push high ground against it, unless the entire team has blink daggers and enters the base over the wall or something crazy.\n\nI like the concept of Techies, planting mines and traps for the enemy to walk into sounds like a fun thing to do, it lets you attempt to outsmart the enemy by predicting their movements and punishing them for their mistakes. He's unique in that manner, except for TA, but her hero isn't based around that. However, like all things nice, there's got to be some people that ruin it for the rest; the people that sit back all game and do nothing but mine their side of the map. They're the reason that people blindly report Techies players, they're the reason Techies' games go for 2 hours, and they're the reason people simply want the hero to be straight up removed from the game. I don't want Techies removed, but his Remote Mines are straight up painful to play against, because they change the nature of the game in a negative way like no other hero or skill does, and its potential effect on a game is straight up soul-crushing. Unless you're one of those players that sit back and mines the base all game, changing the ultimate would have no effect on how you play the game, and would, in fact, make Techies even stronger, considering it would allow Techies to be even more active in team fights and the game in general.\n\nSorry for the novel I've written, but I find it quite enjoyable to have nice and long discussions with people.
Chad on bluepills, big surprise!  \nClearly not mgtow.
Lol. Epic

ulREKT schLULchz
This tournament shouldnt be a major.\n I guess the place was booked before the new major system came out, and they couldnt adapt.\n\n Thankfully rules will change next season and they wont be able to do that.
Teleportation does not break assimilate, afaik.
How to destroy your reputation in 2 LANs and stupid contracts: an ESL way.
Have I disputed that? I just pointed out both situations have disproportionate kills vs assists ratios
i know i'll get downvoted for going against the circlejerk but you guys need to understand that the ARENA only has **the weekend** available and ESL most likely couldn't book the friday, or i'm wrong and they did it on purpose..who knows\n
I'm mad. Like, seriously mad. I was hoping to stay whole weekend, watching all the playoff games, but instead of that we're getting THIS. Thank you ESL, first Facebook, now this. I wonder, what's next on your plan to fuck up.\nIt doesn't hit me so hard, since I live like around 30 kilometres from Katowice, but what about people, who are coming from other countries? Paid hundred of dollars for hotels, flights, saved for food and all, only just for four games? And what the hell is this about single elimination?\nRight now I'm really considering staying at home and watching the tournament on B-dog's stream or anyone else.
like it's easy to find another arena in katowice worthy of a major. they chose it because IEM katowice is weekend after so they don't have to send 2 different productions to 2 different locations
unpopular opinion: think bf is fine if you can get it in a reasonable time 
Fuck ESL. 
i dont like any teams in sea or china i prefer watching na or sa 
ESL really makes a case for Valve to bring Valve majors back.\n\nIt was those jackasses (and tobi) whining to valve to get more events ,now they have them and they half ass them. So what is it 3rd party event organizers? HAlf assing events is absolutely great for the growth of Dota! YOur shit cost us the prestigious 600k+ Viewership majos that bring  Dota in the news in a good light while ESL is a joke and makes dota look like a 3rd tier trash esport.\n\nValve give us the majors back, scrap this dota pro circuit trash and make ESL eat shit
# #fuckESL\n\n
Really? Well done ESL, well done....
you can easily play 3 series(9 matches) in a day and 2 series(8 matches) second day... 
yes csgo tournaments are just as shit
i miss valve majors now. even shanghai was better than this esl garbage
ESL strikes again
ESL never gave a shit about anything except profits. Every single event there has been issues and they keep promising to improve but never do. Stop eating the bullshit they spoonfeed us.
learn how to screenshot you subhuman brainless
na is boring :v
Single Elim is the most common format in CSGO by far, which is the game ESL really made their mark. Thats probably why they're doing it here.
Bruno: "gaben we have a problem!Reddit is pissed off again"\n\nGaben:" *sigh* let me guess,its Ulrich?  What has ESL done now?!"
But... you can. As I mentioned the enemy might have died to towers or creeps i.e. no player deliver the killing blow.
What did people expect? if they're buying tickets for just a weekend, they should know that there will only be a certain number of matches able to be played in that time period.
Eleague is overrated, they are a multibillion dollar company and aren't able to stream in non upscaled 1080p (which is terrible for csgo).\n\nTheir production is average at best and their out of game content is cringe at best.
You booked games for a weekend. How do you think they would be able to fit in more than 4 series? If you look at all Tier 1 Tournaments the Grand Final is always separate on a Sunday, and the most you can reasonably fit on the Saturday is 3 BO3s.
what the actual fuck ? but arent weekend matches playoffs or something ?
ESL LUL
stop supporting these retards. don't buy tickets. don't watch their streams. don't follow their social media accounts. the company is run by fucking out-of-touch idiots.
Nope, its quite literally what happened, he dropped it on himself, but was too close to the treeline so it moved further down towards the T1.\n\nHe actually straight up walked away from it because he assumed he instantly picked it up, its during the time he turns back to grab it VP went on him.\n\nObserved between 6-9 seconds here, you see him issue move commands on himself because hes expecting to pick up his item. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN9P10529KM
hi, am a scrub crusader 4, but willing to try and have fun \n\nsteam tag: destroy the bourgeois

My favorite esport is halo. We have had esl the past two years. I cannot begin to tell you the level of stupid shit we've had to deal with. Just for fun google halo world championship 2017.\n\nOne of the worst things we've dealt with was missing important matched on stream. Either amateur teams would get stream time over pros or the stram would end while pro matches continued to be played. We watched more matches on periscope than the main stream.\n\nI say all this to say 3 things. Fuck esl. Seriously they are washed up and need to be replaced by better TOs. Also i feel your pain. They helped drive my favorite game into the ground. Finally as a new fan through optic, it sucks that i cant get away from esl's bullshit. Dota 2 and esports in general deserve so much better than esl is able to or willing to give
Nothing new here. Just ESL living up to their reputation.\n\nNow where's my pitchfork...
I member when esl frankfurt was 7 BO3, 24h of entertainment in two days  \nnow I'll admit, that was a bit packed, but fuck it was good
well who gives a fuck about ESL. seems like they are on a mission to destroy esports...
&gt; Tobi,(what a surpriise) was wrong and people forced valve into this garbage\n\nCan you link me where tobi condemned the Valve only system? Not saying it doesn't exist, would just like to see it.\n\nEDIT: Also don't know how fair it is to say they FORCED Valve into it. People had influence over it, sure, but ultimately it was Valve's decision to make.
so you want to fuck up one of the semi finalists who gonna advance to final?
Really? Considering I've been following CS since Katowice 2015, Ive never once seen a front page thread asking for it? neither have I seen tournaments like cs_summit getting praise for using it over single elimination. its the norm for us, like double elimination is the norm for dota
Why not have a main stage and side stations. Run multiple series at once. Give people a chance to see these teams play
Awful. Navi with rodjer and sonneiko is better.
IMO!!

Renting out stadiums is expensive. Mystery solved everyone. They don't 'hate the community', they're not going out of their way to fuck you over, they just want to find a way to make running tournaments like this sustainable. Jesus, the level of hysteria on here sometimes is embarrassing.
Good to know, i am sure a lot of other people are very interested, too!
Actually feel sad for the middle level folks at ESL. Brainless top management is so out of touch.
Glap you fucking retards ESL
People have to come there from abroad. For 4 games? Not worth it imo. Thanks ESL, it was supposed to be first Major I attend and you managed to fuck it up
Fuck Esl we dont forget nor forgive
Classic ESL really
bahblahblah. "put more content in" you mean the content that was on twitter right?\n\ncan you do us a favor and fuck off back to csgo? I know,they hate you as much as we do,but at least there you have your little WESA club making money behind valves back.
no fuck off.
CSGO really doesn't hate ESL lol, you don't know what you're talking about. Also looking at your past comments you just seem to be an angry kid down voting and abusing everything you see.
Maybe take 2 seconds to read the post before making a retarded comment like that. Future ESL's will have 3 days in the arena. This one could not because it was booked well in advance and the owners of the arena won't allow for a 3rd day. Nothing to do with money or compendiums or whatever.
Did you fuck the ticket buyers up the ass on purpose?
Nah, their format has always been shit. 
I went to ESL Genting with 16 teams but only show \n\n5 matches!!\n\n 4 of which went 2-0\n\nI thought that was bad.\n\nBUT THIS IS FUCKING MAJOR ?!?! \n\nPeople fly in from different continent for this shit? \n\n
Let's just hope that the audience won't get kicked out of the venue in the middle of a series, just like in Krakow.  \n\n^^^^^^Gotta ^^^^^^love ^^^^^^Polish ^^^^^^events
Are you actively trying to fuck up every tournament? Because it really seems so.
ESL knew that this was a major complaint MONTHS before the event was to happen and instead of letting buyers know so they could cancel their trips and save their money  they wait until the event is in 10 days to let anyone know that they will show 4 fucking games live.\n\nFuck you ESL. I hope you fade into obscurity with all of these slimy acts you're doing.
Excuse from ESLJohannes in 3, 2, 1, ...
Scientists Baffled at this company's ability to fuck up every time.
nice major ESLUL
You are saying it like ESL wasn't trying some new scummy, anticonsumer, esport damaging and barely legal practice monthly and they didn't deny information for as long as they could to make sure you couldn't refund or create backlash that would affect their sales.
I was going to this tournament and was actually quite excited about another major in Europe... especially the 16 team format. not driving all the way to Poland for watching 4 teams tho. I was considering not going after how the esl staff acted on twitter around the last comp but I thought "hey ... I can at least still watch some of my favorite teams ... also teams like navi and optic I don't usually see." \n\nNow It will be the same 4 teams I alrdy watched in hamburg. Gg esl
I’ve said it before and i’ll say it again. FUCK ESL
First FB ONLY stream and now THIS? WTF? I just do not like this fucking ESL. NO MORE MAJORS FROM ESL PLZ.
ESLUL is back boys
EA must have the most retarded bussiness model ever.\n\nESL :  Hold my beer .

FUCK ESL. boycott these idiots.
What a fucking shit show ffs
ESL is fucking awful. I really hope valve stop's parterning with them for any fucking reason.
TL:DR- ESL doesn't know what gaming audiences want anymore, too blinded by Facebook/advertising money. ESL new slogan- Money good, audience at events or online who cares.
This is not even Esl final form of shit housery.
Still lost by the rules he made trying to cheat lol
There is a fucking ONE match on sunday. ONE FUCKING FINAL.\n\nIm actually living in Poland and I was really happy about this event, me and my 3 bois are going, tickets are bought, rooms are booked.\n\nWe took day off the work to be able to come back calmly after expecting 22:00 closing. And we will probably manage to make it in same day, what a fucking joke.\n\nThis is the first Dota 2 event in Poland, that was really good way to promote this game in here, go fuck yourself ESL.
he clearly doesnt know where to spend his money anymore
he looks like ISIS member who will going to behead some hostages
OMG! They made chen into a real thing Xd EcksDEE
I once argued that I would not roll for mid, he rolled a 14 and said roll. I said no, because I will lose. He ended up giving me mid and asked me to roll anyway and I got a 1. Everyone laughed and instead of being angry with me refusing to give up mid they felt bad for me.
&gt; **Posts about Dota 2 personalities doing something completely unrelated to Dota 2 are not allowed.**\n\nBut dang it! Upvoted.
it's 50/50 chance
The man he bought the camel ride from loves Germany. He'd like to move there someday. Kuro got the scarf from him for free, because he loves Germany. He stuffed some postcards into Kuro's bag because he loves Germany and just wants Kuro to be happy, all free. He's saving up to move to Germany. His family is poor and needs help though, could Kuro give him 10euro? Kuro only has a 20euro bill, but the egyptian man will change it for him. Kuro gives him 20euro.\n\nWhat 20euro?
haha DAE think it happens or it doesn't?? xd
u show him da wae
proof?
The game doesn't give anymore good drops. This sub has now resorted to posting rolls in chat.\n\n\\#dotapoverty
Take my upvote, not rolling for mid does not make you an asshole.
So you're telling me there's a chance
Wouldn't it be 1 in 20? Considering the decision of Higher/Lower is 1/2 and the chance to roll higher is ~1/10 (9/100)?
Lol
no friends or what? shit post.
Wooosh
Isn't it 9% since 90 doesn't actually beat it?
This is more entertaining than good drops.

Just hope envy drafting weird heroes again and just for this time boom don't do 322 or 644... :)
do u ppl even go outside on saturdays or do just spend 12 hours watching a guy play dota
LMFAO
Why are you downvoted? Lmao.
and i also wonder why someone of universe caliber would want to play with ee as captain... 
The other guy would not have changed his mind in case the rolled number was lesser. (Lets take 80 for the sake of convenience of this comment)\n\nHence the prob. of this happening are \n    20/100 * 10/100 * 100\n    = 2 %\n\nPoint being chances are far less than 10%
Envy is so dumb. I am betting envy will tilt now and go pipe on spectre first item after boots!
God BoomID threw away all their lead with that dumb teamfight at top, Exorcism already popped, they saw clock and WL get level 6 and Brew split was just used ffs.
rtz's donger when he closes in on qop's *new round booty*
That's nothing. I got 13.000 hours on all accounts together.
(^ ^_^ ^)
Whatever system Valve has in place to hand out 6 month bans, I'm fairly certain we can be sure on the back of this evidence that it doesn't work.
If its on 0minute yes in paper Fnatic had a great teamfight all along with Roar-Haunt-Hook-Golem but BoomID were 5-6K gold ahead and was having good money in MK. \n\nAt that rate MK will get his Fury fast to BKB and actually get them a chance at winning, its just really dumb to still tp and fight when your crucial ults just went down and then your judgement goes you'd want to fight a 5man team with Exorcism already popped.
it doesn't take a wizard to divide 10 by 100 friend :)
Rip boomid \n\nJustice for ee. Fanatic just too good at punishing the dives.
my OCD triggered
BTW if you're using stuff like 'feelsbadman' outside of very specific parts of the internet you've gone too far
EE is still not top tier?u fucking punks are never satisfied are you?Hope you enjoy being bitter cause he definitely love being the greatest
Will probably lose to TNC in the semis, or Mineski in the finals anyway. I don't see them qualifying to anything soon. 
greatest what? pffft
you guys picked a really bad draft into that lineup, crazy to see that though.
That's what you deserve fucking slark spammer.
No, its Mat-hands-hit, probably a subreddit about Mat clapping.
are you fucking serius? i need source plz
Fun fact, by saying 'lowest wins' he reduced his chances of winning to 1%.\n\nEdit:\n\n* The other guy will never accept the new rule if he rolls lower than 90\n* The other guy will accept the the new rule if he rolls over 90\n* Rolling exactly 90 will cause a reroll? I guess it'd be 0.5% chance of winning then, whoops. 
Personally I hate that they "balanced" everything this way, you can get insane lead, one bad fight and you've basically lost the game. You can solo kill 1v1 mid in laning stage 4 times, then he kills you once and he gains everything back with that one kill. \n
Not really.\n\n1/10, that you win with that roll,\n1/100 that you draw that round and 1/2 that you win with the next one(s).\n\n1/10 + 1/100*1/2 = 21/200, so it's 21/200 that you win.
Look at all the counters. \n\nEvery radiant hero is dependent on spells and Mana for maximum impact. OD steals Mana and intelligence. OD also does bonus damage to illusions. Chrono is great for catching qop and hitting bristle from front, while slardar can give negative armor to any hero stuck in Chrono. Jakiro has great crowd control and aoe damage against illusions, and is good at stopping Sb in his tracks. \n\nUrsa is a solid counter to BB because his hits are high damage instances and ulti mitigates damage. 
Nope. A 90 is a draw, so chances are 9%\n\nEdit: They don't call me math god for no reason! Well they don't call me math god... so ofc it is 1/10
Possibly not at all, same with this guy.\n\n\nWhat it should made you think is *why people are toxic in a first place* and think about it again, because if you will try to fit everyone into one "hes the bad guy from those bad guys" cookie cutter, you'd be already wrong..\n\n\n\nLet's see what we can learn.\n\n\n- Exibit here seems to play mostly ranked with mostly good itemisation and winrate, he also seem to have low behaviour rating\n\n\n\n- Never showed familiar behaviour (26 lose treak) in his entire career, actually seems to quit his loses short if he's not winning alot\n\n\n- Played on eu server in the middle of the night, (if he lives somewhere with less than 100 ping to russians, with f behaviour score, on weekend, in morning hours, like many of us know means teams of purely worst russians this earth has bred every game).\n\n\n\n\n\n- Played these games through the entire night (midnight saturday, three am sunday, six am sunday - ones I checked, he also **played over 50 matches in quick succession**), all in lp, even with his afking and feeding he'd come back to them if he noticed chance for victory.\n\n\n\n- Before he mostly would go afk only when given clearly trolling and toxic teams, and would play any position with good success on **5k divine2 high skill bracket**, ranks and brackets still mean less than shit, but we all know how reddit loves em, by reddit's eye this guy is a *pro*\n\n\n\n- His previous lp he received for spamming pudge (I'd reprot any pduge player as well, no shame in that) and going afk in one mag game where his team had 4 cores and lost all lanes\n\n\n\n- he got 4 lp for that and won them in 6 games, followed it by row of ranked victories, his lp now he got after 5 ranked loss streak with two last him going afk, IN THESE TWO GAMES one was 5 core russian fest with jugnling feeding meepo, all lanes lost, including jungle, and 5 core game with mid qop with nick "i am done" in caps,bf(never finished) pa without dotabuff, bf void and pudge into hard push strat with tb and prophet where he nearly came backa t 17 min mark but got aciented at 20.\n\n\n\n\n- that resulted in probably 5lp, week after the last one, that he attempted to win at first (1-4) result, but then gave up after an hour long lone druid game he lost **where he had to play as +1 to 4 man premade** HO FUCKIGN NESTLY in every valve game, even attempting to start game with 4 players in team should result in autoban, few things pisses me more.\n\n\n\n\nThat was his start to the weekend, that caused something to break and him to feed in next 26 games and only play with victory in sight.\n\nBut taking his recotd of tryharding I'd guess there was weird logic in his madness, maybe trying to sped up losing by causing teammates to abandon to reroll heroes he got in single draft?\n\n\n\nBy the way he started At the begining of the weekend and is still playing now, **he took no break this night, guy is drunk on sleep deprivation right now** and won hard game as sand king.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs guy probably super toxic in game? I'm sure of it. Who's fault is this? Mostly valve's matchmaking.  \n\n\nMy verdict is: innocent, especially if he don't know how the whole behaviour rating works. Who we probably got here is a tryhard competitive player on a slippery slope. Unless he speaks russian that is, then ye, ban this guy for playing on euw.
Not that I'm not OK with it but why did you type the title as if it was a clickbait news headline
All evidence says he's innocent though. High skill, high success, first case of such behaviour, first 5 lp long punishment, I'd say if he got banned that would be a reason to riot.
Thats just 2 tips tho...\n\nEdit: nvm he just didnt number the last one\n
Their fans are annoying 
&gt; He would leave the song on for the full duration and try to time the hammer impact with the end of the song. He missed it. Every. Fucking. Time.\n\nNaga song is an aura and auras linger for 0.5 seconds after ending it. I guess that's why he missed?
Can confirm, super annoying
Naga song is an aura, and auras linger for 0.5s after the bearer has exited the area (in this case, after you end the song, the effect still stays for 0.5s)\n\nMight be the reason
Hes probably abusing the Commendations.\n\nas long as he gets some commends in his behavior report, he will not be outright banned\n\nand will just be considered cancerous.\n\nAlso some people love commending feeders, since they love getting the EZ win.
Yee on sea our average iq is low combined with shit pc's and different languages. 
Yeah, that's what I found on google too
Yep, I like that better. Too lazy to look for it though
Is it just me or am I seeing fewer EE cocksuckers in these threads? They were so fucking obnoxious when Fnatic won a qualifier w/o TNC &amp; w/ an incomplete Mineski. But their messiah has accomplished nothing since and they've been quiet as well. Are they just patiently biding their time? Or have they become woke from the Church of wEEboo?
/r/theydidthemonstermath
That was a very educational video by Blitz, and again I'm not disagreeing with him. \n\nYou want your lanes to be pushed as far as possible at all times (post laning phase obv), which forces the enemy team to respond in some way, creating space/opportunities for you by putting pressure on them.\n\nBut you definitely do *not* want your cores dying because you have 3 people showing in different lanes, where one of them is a SK who could turn around a gank perfectly. 
Why EE isnt retired yet, so bad lmao
hey guys! i got similar playlist to arturo music since we have same toaste in music :\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/ragnar_doto/playlist/6vILOyKftfnIrgQifBshBN?si=-8X5_CYhTPywzafNQeyi_w\n
imagine if ee would play that void, comments would be full of hate. 
I used to enjoy Dota in 2014
right now the max is 9 comments, its super annoying
str threads whole time , 2/10 efficiency 
What do you mean logic? [That is shadow pool](https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=133856&amp;page=25&amp;p=1082330&amp;viewfull=1#post1082330). You get put in a team with other offenders vs normal teams. Naturally shadow pool team loses since they are all tilted. 
that 1kmmr void, why didn't he hit the creeps with bf?? 
Ez downvote, sorry
Slark is good, but in certain situations, when enemy are squishy or don't have much stuns. More situational pick than before.
Sure, we got pinoy. But they got russians. So I guess it evens out?
Amazing player and EE in a same sentence OMEGALUL
How is a high-profile game like LGD/VGJ.T being cast by a guy who misses 70% of what goes on in the game, doesn't understand pro decision making and doesn't even provide decent play-by-play?
Completely different case tho. Skemberlu is an unproven nobody playing for an unproven team with a bunch of unproven nobodies. EE, on the other hand, is an established pro with a cult-like following who serves as carry (carried?), captain, drafter, and LeGM of an established franchise featuring established veterans w/c include a TI-winner, a top tier Pos 4 player, a 10k mmr player, and EE's personal bitch who happens to also be a decent pos 5 player. Ofc people's expectations of the 2 would be so damn different.\n\nAlso, yes, Void was a shitshow. But I've been watching a shitton of qualifiers and from my experience as a 5.7k casual dota player, I believe that Skemberlu has served as a much much much much more reliable carry for Geekfam than EE has been for Fnatic.
dude get a life. 
I honestly don't understand why as well. Every excuses are either: he's the captain, pros want to play with him or he's won a major. \n\nPeople are so blind. 
Yup even for someone that doesn't play dota can see that EE is a bad carry compare to other tier1-2 carry, he's tier3 at best
rofl ur so autistic
Who wants to play with EE? He's in SEA in the first place because no teams wanted him. Abed and Universe had no choice because they were teamless and EE was definitely convincing them to join. 
Idk man I think they're back again.
Ur qop is shite. 
i'm not from NA, so can someone explain why these rappers using the n word on their songs? isn't the word degrading to them or something? 
are you okay? Does stalking other people's accounts make you feel better? get well soon.\n\n
Yeah. They won their group so they're boldly out in the open again. Let's see what happens tomorrow
are you really saying Abed and universe had no other choices? lmao. and you call ppl "blind". not even a reason to argue here. 
Ran out of these 'pros' to play in NA or EU? Why ran so far to SEA then?
hi afk your surname is btw?
FeelsBadMan i member that build
Dude get a brain
The comeback mechanics were introduced in late 2016 though, I think. I get why I am being downvoted though, average redditor usually is the one who lost his lane and is behind, so this comeback mechanic is suiting him (you) well.  
Idk maybe because Fnatic was his best option? I dont hold to that statement Im just saying the reason why people kept saying these stuffs.
I see. So you really do need mental help. I'm honestly concerned so I'll try to make you feel better by clarifying things. I'm a casual lurker with no "main account" whose previous short-lived "account" has been banned for getting heavily downvoted by EE cocksuckers such as yourself. So I'm not hiding. I'm forced to create this new account to trigger the EE fangays. Can't stop myself. It's too much fun.\n\nAlso, I meant it when I said I'm concerned about you. I really am. I apologize if I've actually hurt you in any way so I'm giving you an LPT. Reddit is anonymous. So there's really no new account, fake account, main account, whatever. It's all anonymous. So don't focus on the messenger. Focus on the message. It's not like Facebook where your identity is supposed to be known and you need to concern yourself if the message is coming from new/fake/bot accounts.
I will take russians or peruvians any time instead penoys. At least they doesn't speak english.
2 BFs don't stack additively for cleave... Try something else for third item

My mom wont stop beating me
VGJ is insane with ddc? And how is EG not tier 1? Yes they can't beat liquid or secret, but that doesn't mean they aren't tier 1. 
Um, are there any mods to use this music pack in the game without buying?
yeah this seems to be the answer. the sleep aura effect doesn't go away instantly meaning people closer to naga will have it linger for slightly longer.
There's a $50 difference between $99 and $149, that's way more than 15% lol
Yes it does seem a bit odd the 3rd combo.. but the effect does longer longer closer to naga, and thus distance has to be a factor. That there are some kind of bug/numerical error can still be the casa though
Yeah this game has a lot of bugs. I saw RTZ totally whiff 2 Sonic Waves yesterday.
the frog doesnt care\n\ndota 2 is all about inconsistency\n\neverything thats inconsistent becomes a feature\n\n
&gt; Ran out of these 'pros' to play in NA or EU? Why ran so far to SEA then?\n\nFeelsUniverseMan :(\n\n
trash
Since this happens on the same tick I think it depends on how much heroes are in this combo. Like if there are 5 enemies, they dont lose debuffs all together, but rather 1 by 1 in small time periods, then it might happen that 1st processed hero loses debuff from sleep and gets it from hammer, but 2nd one and so on are not able to recieve meteor hammer debuff, since their sleep debuff loss has not been processed yet
And that's why you love Na'vi right? 
Chen's send-back and kotl's recall. One of them is affected by hero damage, the other isn't.
Reminds me of a game from today, my team has mid Viper vs Brood and a useless fuck who picked Bristle when team has fuck all disable and initiation, ofc enemy team starts wrecking, their offlane Timber has like 12k networth 20 min in and pretty much no one to deal with him, enemy jungle WK with min 9 midas into min 18 Radiance, i recognize my team is shit and make a Midas to rush Aghs (they had 5 melee), my CM gets Vessel to deal with Timber's regen, then Atos to lock him down, basically we 2 fucked them all until our Dusa came online and we won game. 
You and everyone he played with deserve it. If you're playing with him it means you have the same shitty behavior score that he has.  \n
damn, now I want russians instead of pinoys
this is already 1
That's BS. You can just cast it towards the end of the song. Your bad timing doesn't mean you need to shift click it.
What have you been smoking?
Personally I got sick of it after one game. Sounds horribly repetitive in a bad and noticeable way 
Actually it is. Any player above 5k should be able to do it with his eyes closed. Just as even if SF has perfect timing you can euls yourself without shift click. Getting downvotes by 3k's is funny...
&gt;The strange part is, if you have multiple enemies within the meteor area, sometimes, only some of them may get hit. This I cannot explain at all.\n\n\nCouldn't it be because of the way the Naga song shrinks when it gets disabled. Thus targets closer to Naga wake up later.\n\nI'm not sure about it, since I'm not a naga player, but that's how I always thought it'd be.
Spaghetti coding at its best.
it's bad imo. the whistling track makes me feel bored in some way. 
for what
demo mode isn't the same as real match
that blank spaces between numbers and dots ayyy
Despite trying to catch most CN qualifier games, I actually didn't see him for a while, which made his appearance in the grand finals today all the more jarring. In my mind he doesn't cast more than other low tier casters.\n\nIt's totally understandable that there are few people willing to cast Chinese qualifier matches, xyclopz just sticks out like a sore thumb in games where high-level decision making is going on. When things are more clowny, his overexaggerated style fits better, even though I personally still don't like it.
so you are saying Kotl's spell is not used to save people ? 
yep this is the ideal solution. hopefully Valve will consider it. They should also fix the report format, it's simply bad because of it's simplicity. I had my chat banned while I didn't even type anything on my games.
You've clearly never played past 4k. My euls timing is 1.69 on SF with 95% reliability and confidence (stats) ; once again getting downvotes by ignorant and unskilled chimpanzees - have a field day.\nOh! And it's not because you're unable/incompetent or don't factor in actual game play that it can't happen or doesn't work.
VGJ Thunder: signs competent players, becomes top 2-3 team in china, top 6-7 team in the world right now easily\n\n\nVGJ Storm: signs retarded NA players like BSJ, disbands like a month after getting him OMEGALUL
dafuq u on about?\n\nchen has to be close to the target, can only send people to base. \n\nkotl can use it globally, asking for assistance. it's quite the opposite actually.\n\nif you wanted an 'inconsistency' example, you could have said lion and nyx, having both the 'same skill' one being targetable, the other one not. and yet that has NOTHING to do with incosistency as its being discussed here
Meaningless comments or explanations from a self-graving Dazzle player. 
that has still made more money playing a fucking video game than you will in you life. lul.
I wonder if valve actuall has enough competence to release anything without major bugs. Even just some minor tooltip change that doesn't break picking.
Secret ? They were favorites going into Kiev ? They were favorites against SGE, but winning the tournament ? I am not sure.\n\nIts not a hindsight-heavy view, they struggled at multiple points throughout the season, they didn't do well at DAC, Kiev and MDL.  They weren't favorites, do you understand the meaning of favorites ? Liquid and LFY were favorites for me. Newbee coming in 2nd was a surprise and so was EG finishing 9th-12th, I didn't expect them to finish so low but I didn't expect them to win either.
What a fucking hypocrite, look at your teammates first, there is at least one clip every week with Pasha destroying his items
bc ixmike88 actually did a lot for dota
Ehmmm he is one of the most toxic players. Actually so disgusting. Also was a werid guy in FPL games from what I have heard through teamspeak .
You people are actually fucking idiots.  You see a handful of instances of him having done it over the thousands of fucking pub games he's played and you think you know the guy.  He's ranked 55 right now.  If he was really so shitty in all his games, he wouldn't be able to get that high of a rank.  It's clearly the exception and not the rule.
i have this one only giftable , if someone interested pm me im giving it for cash only\n
FN! is an absolute piece of shit, as are Noone, Alohadance and quite a few others. Also plenty of nice people in CIS, but they have their bad apples and those are a few of them
How much
This is turbo, no way this guys level 20 with radiance blink bots and a vanguard 16 minutes into the game\n
7th/8th isn't big.\n\nNo one gives a shit about a team that places there these days.\n\nOnly reason people remember mike is because NA were garbage for 3 years and it was the first time a NA team got into the money with a single hyped Bo1.\n\nIf it was the first time for say a SA team to make top 8 at TI, I really doubt this NA dominated sub would give a shit.
What feat does he have to prove that?
&gt; best blink dagger user\n\nIm gonna argue with you bout that
I beat him 54% of the time. Something I do is working lol. I even won an 84 minute game on Ursa against tinker lol
is this a joke? pretty good one tbh
some players dc through console command, since i started doing it became muscle memory and now it takes less then .25 for me to dc from the game. Many pros do the same thing thus it's not an indicator of their toxicity. But yeah FN is a raging piece of shit\n
/roll 1-100
&gt; Nah, storm meepo and AM are all pretty easy to destroy regardless of the picks and counterpicks.\n\nfor a good AM player 80% of the game is the draft, 20% is how his team plays. and a hero with lvl 1 mana burn on attack and then blink/spell resist who buys RoH and can easily go oov is not a weak laner by any stretch of imagination.
You forgot to photoshop out the red arrows below your losses.
Well just pick Tinker then lul
WAOW hahah /roll so funny once again\n\nTHANKS REDDIT
*lol*\n\nClassic ice
what about AM screams "weak laning"?
Ice God 
i thought ice was commentating for a sec

do a /roll dude haha

dude you can't just XD here, wanna get banned 
Hey, I have a full-time job pal.
Smart ass replies are toxic now?  Toxic is becoming a buzzword with little meaning because of you.
just leav
:thumbsup::disappear::thumbsup:
If you can't figure it out from the context alone, you are retarded.
By undermining the British while the fought the nazi?
the real question is, why is so farmed with 86 creeps and 3/4/4?
word
someday they are going to buff ES.  its going to be nuts.
thats my man
Dealing with Tinker is easy and doesn't necessarily require Clock. Pudge, Zeus, Nyx, Pugna, Storm, Spectre...\n\nMost people who complain that Tinker is OP are the idiots that first pick PA and Sniper every game.
it amazes me to think people go bananas at a 1% chance of something and even tell people to play the lottery when the odds of winning something like that are astronomically lower.
lol
Dopamine level 9000
because magic build
By the time you have HOTD and are hitting T1 a good thinker will have travels and melt your wolves/catapult/jungle creep or just stop your push. I have over 70% WR on Lycan and can tell you don't counterpick him.
Part of the reward of getting better at Dota is playing with better players. If you encounter a guy with ~10 matches when you've 1000 matches or more is debilitating. \n\nNot that it happens often, of course. \n\nThere was a time, after Valve implemented behaviour score matchmaking to give new players a "postiive" experience by matching them with older players with high behaviour score.. with the same skill of course.\n\nI guess this works in high population servers, but for South Africa it was fucking horrendous, since behaviour score was now the defining factor, not skill. I can't teach a guy how to play Techies in his 2nd match ever while getting run at by Bara + PA in mid in the 20 minutes it took us to lose the match. \n\nIIRC that moronic idea was conceived and pushed for here on reddit. It's better to just let the new players joust it out on their own, and eventually the ones capable of improving will eventually work their own way up. There's no need to hand hold and coddle everyone, it's a waste of time.\n
This\n\nLycan is 3x the cancer. But at least the games over before you can even fucking blink
Balance in all things.
I always go for “you roll, i take even numbers”, apparently going for higher has the same chances and more fun
&gt; the fact remains that it is only very strong given certain conditions. \n\nCitation needed. There are people that literally first pick Tinker every game in top 100 solo ranked because they know they can't be countered. These other factors would show in the stats, the fact remains that tinker's item timing on blink on average is far more important than any other item timing in the game, which both supports my argument and directly contradicts yours. I need sources. 
Who are the casters? great colour hype at the end of the lol.
your 2k knowledge is amazing

If i was you i wouldnt be typing this comment, dude hasnt gain shit in a long time, both in reddit and irl.

that was just an incredible play by KuroKy
It reminds me of my first dota1 game online. I just did nothing and died like 3times and I called out sry guys I’m new. They said just leave.\n\nAnd then I spent another 3 months playing against bots with friends and watching pro’s video before start pvp game again.
Brutal
i somehow snorted saliva out my nose at the all chat ow fuck

50000 minutes is still less. Time required is forever
He threw his lottery chance right there you guys
lol can't be justified by the play he made.\n\nhe made the guy feel worse.\n\n
thats a 20k$$$ fine -blizzriot.
There are heroes that counter him, negate his magic damage, or can tank and return damage with return abilities and/or BM. If someone instalocks Tinker and you still don't have something that can tank him or counter him, it's your fault.\n\nIf you are wandering aimlessly on map without your teammate after picking squishy cores and die against an instalock first pick tinker than that's still your fault.\n\nYour stubborn insistence to play this game the only way you love to play is more detrimental to your progress in this game instead of people who instapick tinker.\n\nIt's the same wit Techies, Storm Spirt, Ember spirit, Ursa, Pudge, BB, Axe and other heroes who demand special modifications in game play.\n\nImagine a team that picks 5 melee hero against a first pick insta lock Axe. That's how absurd it is to whine about Tinker players who insta pick Tinker. You have 5 chances to deny him an easy win. Take those chances. And modify your gameplay.
Because he missed his lottery chance right there yes?
You are really nice person and I appreciate that, but I think that if a player behaves like a dick you shouldn't let him do whatever he wants and hope for +25. If community lets people instalock invoker and say "fuk u me mider" they won't ever stop doing it. Imagine that someone burned down your home on purpose. Even though you won't get your home back you should still call the police to deliver the punishment. This way the criminal stops committing crimes, and people that could potentially become criminals realize that crime doesn't pay\n\nEdit: spelling mistakes
Easy, just pick between "head" and "tail" instead of whatever you're calling in your country. lol
30$ bucks
Worst as a piece of shit - Chappie.\nWorst as in an inconsistent mess and questionable plays - EE
gyro attacked a creep 
i played with this asshole in ranked 3 games and he sold all his items to buy a fucking shadow amulet and afk all 3 games lol worst player ever.
EE is trash.\n\nAdd to that - &gt; EE captaining. \n\nAdd to that - &gt; EE drafting.\n\nSo triple trash basically. 
fnatic is trash team since EE. 
EE is the problem.\n\nMeme aside they have some of the greediest cores. Not sure why add universe, just doesn't make sense.\n\nThey often get out drafted\n\nThere cores struggle to play from behind.
EE is the problem, as he drafts and shits the bed almost every game.\n\nWaiting for his pizza party courtesy Fnatic (co sponsored by Ohaiyo)
EE is a burden
the team has always been trash even since ohaiyo. they lack consistency especially the carry. well i would say it’s because he’s playing pos 1 and captaining at the same time. drafting really isn’t EE’s strength he should stop. Aside from fnatic’s poor performance, i’ve gotta give credits to TNC with their new lineup i’m surprised i don’t know they would do so well with full 5 PH players. \n\np/s: poor Universe and Ohaiyo tbh.
It's geek fam's gyro, a tier 3-4 team, so that doesn't came as a surprise. 
Savage
EE is just playing bad and has been for a long time, when Ohaiyo was in the team, the excuse was that EE has to draft for Ohaiyo so he is usually forced into disadvantageous lanes so on and so forth\n\nNow when Ohaiyo is gone, its obvious that EE was the problem, his drafting has been shit and playing like shit, he rarely has a good game where he completely dominates its usually Abed that has to carry the hell out of the game. If anything Fnatic are looking like the level that they should be playing at. 
EE's decision-making is just bad. I like EE and I like the players on Fnatic, but there comes a time when you need to assess the abilities of the players. EE just hasn't been performing on any team where he puts himself as the captain. The last time EE was touted as good was when he was playing for Secret under Puppey.\n\nIf EE has to stay on the team, someone else on the team has to call the shots, not him. But the better option would be for EE to look for another team.
Rekt
To be honest they all played horrible and lackluster.
I wonder what excuses EE's gonna make right now, Ohaiyo's limited hero pool my ass. EE clearly has no passion for Dota anymore, he's just there to collect his paycheck to fund his annual anime convention in Japan.
they cant really do that except for saying glhf/pauses/calling gg\n\nprobably ok in qualifiers but not on LANs
EE draft are really really bad. \n\nThat Bounty pick and BB thooo....
Are you referring to /r/admiralbulldog ? Krappa
ee likes anime\n\nanime is trash
Neo Nazis on my Dota subreddit. \n\nEven slander again Churchill. 
He wants to make it look like he still cares. Otherwise he's getting kicked. Probably convinced other Fnatic players that Ohaiyo was the problem hereby diverting attention that he's the problem.
Haters downvoting you lmao. \n\nFN is a piece of shit but he's also an insaneeee player haters gonna hate\n\n
envy carry networth &lt; DJ networth
Did you watch OG playing against literally all of these teams in group B?\n\nIt's not even close. It makes no difference at all which group OG is in 
It's a qualifier. One team goes through. It will be OG 95% of the time. This actually gives the highest chance that they get knocked out in Quarters and Semis, If they played groups in the stronger group they would play them before elimination games and then would walk over the non ranked group A.
Ill never understand how ANY pro player would want to play with Envy. While he is truly skilled and knowledgeable, 10 minutes of watching his stream would be enough for me to never want to play with him.\n\nImagine being in the most important game of your career and having that annoying, mumbling, screaming voice in ur head half the time and your carry building pipe on his Drow Ranger or having picked absolute trash cuz dood overthinks everything.\n\nEE teams will never be successful if he doesn't change his approach to dota imo
Valve has to step up and give more rules about how a tournament has to be done, along with how the invites should be. This is getting ridiculous.
It does for the other teams.
Im not pro but I can see that EE is the weakest link. He's trash
ee is literally the WROST fuckingn player right now i dont know why\nfnatic just keeps him in the fucking team hes Bringing down ABED and DJ which are the TWO best South EAST ASIAN players in the ENTIRE south east ASIA.\n\nfnaic need to KICK ee now or else they don't be able to win a single game \n\nEE IS the PROBLEM..\n\nFNATIC ROSTER\n\n1. EE - worst FUCKING PLAYER EVER\n\n2. Abed - Top 3 MID player SUPER prodigy SUPermiDlee\n\n3. TI WINNING universe - BEST and most STABLE offlane palyer of all TIME no quetoin\n\n4. DJ - NO question best position 4 in south east asia that plays psotion 4 in south east asia\n\n5. PIE liE DIE - TOP 2 position 5 player - theres a reason why puuppey (ti winner btw) chose him on his team for so long\n\nTHeres i NO WAY fnatic can loze with this Roster.. EXCEPT BEFACUE of EE!!!!\nOMG ABED JUST KICK ee LAREDy
Felt bad for Abed and DJ. :(\n\nFelt so good EE&amp;PIE lost. \n\nFelt even better tasting those sweet sweet nectar tears of a particular player's fans. \n\n:)
I think a team with EE could be fine but only if EE is not the captain. They would need a captain and shotcaller and EE has to shut up and focus on doing his job as a carry. \n\n/Also I don't know anything about the internal dynamics of fnatic and I'm just talking out of my ass. But that's what I think would be best.
But on the other hand, they did win MLG with him captaining. 
You can't play fearing that you'll be kicked or worse every second\n\nSkill aside, EE is simply toxic. It's happens all the time. It happened to all his teams. There's always drama. Always questionable decisions. Always games throw etc\n\nThe one team EE had reasonable success was when he was with Puppey who wouldn't take his shit\n\n
EE is like a worse n0tail, except he's not a sacrificial carry but just trash
TNC without 1437 is much stronger. That paired with a not fitting draft, leads to these results. Fanatic wasn't that good. They sunsfaned to tournaments, not qualified for them. And now that mineski is back in the qualifiers, we have this.
everyone keeps shitting on EE but abed was 0/6/0 in the first game at some point, had less NW than the 4pos of TNC
"How toxic he can be".... is he really toxic? He doesn't flame in pubs, his teammates have never really said anything bad about. I don't see why you think he would be toxic?
I dont get how hes toxic. memes aside on the ohaiyo kick that wasnt an unreasonable roster change. \n\nFans always think theyre favorite players are better, take a look at bulldog fans and dendi fans when they weren't doing well. it just seems like ee is a lightning rod for all the negativity that goes at the team. they win, abed and dj are god etc but if they do poorly, ee must be a herald complete trash player.
If tinker wasnt there, you would be triggered by the same player playing storm or some other imba heros of the moment.
they dont want [A] to be back :c
But that's how DotA is. Miracle plays also on the edge of fucking up very often. Sometimes it workers, sometimes not. The difference is, that he had and has a team that backs him up most of the time and bring the team back. That's also a thing that fanatic is missing. If ee is in fiftee/fiftee mode, there is no security net. He fucks up one time and the game is over. Miracle fucks up and mc or matu or GH win the game.
That makes no sense\n\nYou're saying you know it makes no difference but you want to pretend it does make a difference \n\nThat's beyond retarded
It has not, like EG seeding in DAC, like 6 invites for chinese teams for DAC, or 6 for EU teams at Dreamleague, like last second surprise invite for EG at Summit, Alliance direct invite to regional quals without having played a single game as a team, or the invites for EG at the start of season being 12th on TI. \n\nTournaments want viewers, not keep the integrity of the scene. And this sucks for us when DPC points are on line.
true as fuck\n\nfucking EE wasting potentials of good players everywhere he goes\n\nDJ and Abed are the unlucky ones here
OR maybe..just maybe..they going through a slump ?\n\nI mean they do have a new player..and its not like they've played a tonne of tournaments since so..
&gt; He doesn't flame in pubs\n\nhave you ever played with this weeb?
EE was most of the times the weak link in his teams. doing stupid mistakes that u rarely see other pos1/2 do, add on that he's drafting and captaining. 
Im not really sure but i think maybe parts of the rules? Or probably just the general ‘rules’
ice3 outplaying some trash team OMEGALUL GLAP
ayy, classic downvotes
he meant to say TOP 5 to make it more convincing to the retards in this thread that he's being genuine because theyll eat up pretty much everything else he wrote\n\nhe should also take off his cloud 9 flair next time
Yeah, all those situations were schedule conflicts. 
What you mean? Are you saying the knowingly chose this bracket to favor OG? Do you have any proof?\n\nWhat would compromise the integrity of the tournament would be to hand make the bracket in some way that is allegedly "balanced"\n\nUntil proven otherwise, this is just a random draw\n\n\n\n
He's using Windows 10, he's the one who's doomed bruh.
the virgin carry actually reminded me of a slark player from singsing's stream where sing memed throughout the match as "my slark is gonna come online any moment now" XD
almost no cooldown with octarine. OPfrog\nnerf that shit a bit. should be atleast have aghs to get to that lvl.\nPlus that cyclone, was annoying as fuck. it really punishes those low bkb duration cores.
Admittedly I haven't watched many of their matches but result wise I'd go with nothing much ?\n\n Tnc isn't the worst team and those match ups with teams that know each other so well often play out a bit different than say an international tournament would and I don't think fnatic was on some sort of huge tear in recent times either. 
?
Where does all the hate come from? You see a Tinker and you just pick Clock. 84% winrate so far against him.
"Scheduling" yeah right. Sounds like a generic excuse to save face. 
Should I commend him or report him?
Yeah they have only played TNC twice with universe. People in this thread are jumping to way too many conclusions just to hate on EE and the roster change. They haven't even lost to Mineski with the new roster and OP saying bullshit like "fnatic like can't standup to Mineski" if that is true then why did they beat them in GESC. In fact aside from TNC the only other SEA teams that have beat them are Geek Fam (first match with the new roster) and Boom ID. The Boom ID loss isn't really defendable, but that seemed like more of fluke than anything to be honest.
?
He fucking keeps saying Shen, not Chen that shit is too much
can you get a rampage denying towers?
So what that he is a participant? He is on the favoured side of the bracket and he may just be echoing what the tournament organisers used as an excuse. That tweet does not clarify anything. 
Wtf is with this caster btw? Disgusting dude. I'm not a particular fan of Bulldog either, but who the fuck does he think he is?
you, sir, are and idiot\n
This was one cringeworthy cast - hope we don't have any more of this guy.
Yeah, this shit is going to get nerfed for sure, it is so dumb for something so impactful as Brew's ult to have a 6 seconds cd...
Kill yourself
i left the stream because of his bad casting n watch the russian stream instead.. i don't understand any of it but at least it's not that bad as this guy
Dude, are you dense? It is generally strong in high level play but not so much in lower level play. Citation being the win rate differential. So whatever is strong in top 100 is kinda irrelevant in crusader level games. 
That cast was really bad... \n\nHere's the twitter "discussion"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ggTeaTime/status/96304715100478259\n\n
This baboon trying to be edgy or something? His Personality clearly reflects Epicenter #hislogic. Well played Epicenter F U
He’s just curiosu on the problem
draft so you set either carry of mid bound to lose hard           \nweird support combos looking at opponent supports           \nobvious victory condition with no backup plan         \npassive early game losing map control       \nreliance on solo plays to make the game, which works vs. less good teams, but once you get to a similar skill level you just lsoe
Can we not pretend it wasnt on purpose? You remember the NA seeding? Are you telling me that none of the 4 teams in group 2 could be moved to group A and still have a schedule?
They were terrible with Ohaiyo as well.  People just want an excuse to call them bad now.  The win against TNC was a miracle and they lost every other series against either them or Mineski, like they have been for AGES.\n\nDon't act like they were good before.
But EE carried team secret through a major a few years ago. LMFAO\n
i dont care about this lesbian's birthday. im just happy shes 1 year closer to death now FeelsGoodMan
Let me know when they introduce gpm bonuses for players based on past performances, maybe Vigoss can make a return.\n\nAnd Secret won that LAN on the back of the Lion + Doom pics.
that's sad 
how many times icex3 split m8
U can easily kill through raindrop as sf.\nHarass a bit with right clicks, and lvl 5 triple raze is easily enough even through raindrop to kill someone.
and the award for the most annoying persomality goes to ice^3 because he can not be beaten in this category. The octarine panda is a whole new level of cancer
U can easily kill through raindrop as sf.\nHarass a bit with right clicks, and lvl 5 triple raze is easily enough even through raindrop to kill someone.
Lower levels are not different conditions, lower levels are not part of the equation when we discuss how good heroes are. 
Moon's DP and Mirana are actually must ban for this patch.
not really
If you are having a hard time with Tinker here is a realistic guide to playing and playing against Tinker:https://youtu.be/sNO28zcbJCI\n              Enjoy the MMR
EE is trash, what is the surprise?
his knowledge is questionable, yesterday when he cast, he said crimson guard effect is lotus orb..omg..he doesn't even know the basic thing..
EG, OG, and Mineski are dominating their respective regions. \n\n\nThese are the teams that should be directly invited.\n\n\nBut hey since Epicenter is only a 12 team format tournament, i can understand that they had to put them in the qualis. \n\n\nUnlike a certain tournament that has 6 Chinese teams. 
I've watched him cast CSGO games before.\n\nHe said on stream that he got dissed by another big CSGO caster (HenryG) because he "jokingly" said that HenryG didn't want to come up and say hi to him.\n\nPersonally I think it's the way he said it. The attitude and personality of this caster sucks big time
RIP EPICENTER Caster Competition. Hopes he get dumped. 
I haven't seen the new Fnatic play much, but it hasn't been long. Doesn't it take a couple months before a lineup with new member(s) gets better together?
Right so I'm not commenting on anything else since obviously that's not going to get me anywhere. That was not joy at bulldog's stream being shut down. That was just me laughing because I remembered that bulldog was the one who triggered the initial reaction on Starladder too. I do see why that's so easily misinterpreted though
7.08 : Raindrop item description changed : " A tear of a crybaby screaming '**tinker op'**"
Thats the right call though.. Farm is way more important early game than killing the enemy carry. \n\nEsp with the amount of gold given out for kills in this patch. 
bulldong nonstop talks shit about most dota players, all women, and all countries except sweden\n\nit was a stupid comment by the caster but people getting this upset is ridiculous
His ego at this point is reaching maniac level.
He is correct. Bulldog is fucking bad.
Sorry Alliance fans, it doesn't matter which group they're in they're still garbage
Yeah nice item spends gold for no stats, no active, no anything...at least if I  buy wards I get  vision 
Fuck this guy. 
Newbee,LGD, VG, and VGJ are the only teams relevant in China at the moment. \n\n\nHaving 6 Chinese teams is too much. Even Epicenter reddit guy fired shots at them. 
How do you quit dota?\n\nedit: people giving serious answers to this question need to read the title of the thread again
Be forewarned, traveler, for (apparently) you have roused the ire of a thousand suns, for the wrath of the 'closest-knittest' community of all of the realm of Internet is an implacable force, and they shall unite under the one banner of the Dong, and they shall punish those who seek to violate what they hold sacred to.\n\nIn other words, the pitchforks will be out to get you. 'Tis reddit after all.
How is techies not in CM yet?
Coincidence? I think not.
tobiwan is an angel
Young and stupid so much ego and has no respect toward a living legend. \n
u sure dont understand  how dota works\nand im sure ure a weebs thats why you indirectly defending EE
He's pretty inconsistent and flip flops a lot, and he tends to call GG way before it gets called by the teams.\n\nThis clip is from that recent Fnatic vs GeekFam game where Abed was TA. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_oISyiZpKA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14m12s\n\nHe starts going on about how Abed is so farmed and they can't kill him, and then literally 30 seconds later Abed is running away almost dead and he says "That's what I was saying, Abed can't get anything done!".
That's even a terrible non-apology. He is saying he phrased it wrong while also blaming everyone else for not thinking he meant it in a good way because he doesn't think celebrities are a bad thing. Then straight up saying he doesn't apologize for throwing shit in everyone's face about valid criticisms of professionalism because people reacted to his shit flinging.
The execution is swift and ruthless.
EE was always the problem...
So much respect for you sir Tobi~!﻿
that pakistani shitbag is taking a massive L right now
If the community that plays dota flamed everyone else in this way then the level of toxicity would decrease dramatically.\n\nWhen you have players which are racist, sexist, zenophobic and threaten to rape and kill your family and tell you to commit suicide at every oppertunity because reasons then this flame seems incredibly polite.\n\nI will take fully professional casting when i get to play dota without the negative issues the community has. \n\nWish i got called a celebrity.
man I definitely love Tobi even more, awesome guy       
There we see an example of wrong usage of the word 'literally'
Mr TobiWan, you are pure evil, LOL
EE is garbage who keeps thinking he's a good captain and drafter while playing as carry.
Bulldog open qualifier team played against OG. It went as expected. Caster said that bulldog is a celebrity at this point rather than a pro player capable of keeping up with OG.\n\nWhile it was a but much, Reddit is obviously acting maturely. ^^^^/s
Fucking rekt.
Not all heroes wear capes.
TIME TO WATCH MY M8 TOBER TEACH SOME MANNERS
We love you, Tobi!
uh dont casters flame NA players all the time and reddit responds with NA LUL KEK xD !\n\nwhy are europeans so sensitive?
Teatime more like pizza party haHAA
And what? If this is personal opinion, who are you to fucking lecture me in the way how it should be?\nYou're implying on xenophobia, yet ur post itself looks very fascist-like.\n\nOr should I say, Liberal-fascist.
His Twitter bio pic makes him look like the very stereotype cultural elitist that would take offense at Bulldog’s low brow brand of humor.
Lol because this community is a bunch of idiots, look at the comments in the main thread  : \n\n'he's a 'Baboon'', why the fuck do people have to be juvenile\n\n'he's from india', 'no, he's from pakistan', 'no he's fucked your mom'\n\nhow does that pertain to his casting ? How does it matter ?
Yeah he's a moron.
Tobiwan Natures Prophet guide is the best omegalul
Terrible amateur caster here. I think monkey see, monkey say is fine if you're casting with someone else who has your back and can break down the fight properly afterwards, but that rarely applies anyway.
thank you Mr. Tobi for the guide
Dont want to get choked, do you? 
Hey Tobi you should make another video on how redditors should handle criticism cause that %username guy% doesn't know how to.\n\nHe acts as if he's a big time redditor by labeling the casters' criticism as #casterlogic.
&gt; complains about a long game\n\n&gt; picks anti mage
I don't think I want to go through the pain all of them went through. It's slightly sad it went on for that long.\n
all this shit because reddit's baby was flamed for 5 second lmfao
I've had little interaction with this individual, however, it hasn't quite been pleasant. "Poor Phrasing" is a good cover up for horrible condescending personality flaw. \n\nAs if the self-proclaimed "Caster Extraordinaire" was not AIDS enough, my first unpleasant experience with his "casting" was when I was looking at his commentary to see how he compared to me as a fellow Pakistani commentator. He commentated on an ESL India match (With piss poor analysis/input of course), and at the end, he types something along the lines of.. \n\n"If this team wants to learn utility usage they can contact me on twitter"\n\n... Incredibly condescending, considering the fact that he has NO professional experience as a CS:GO/1.6 player, and is around Gold nova 3 I believe (From the last stream I watched). For people that don't play DotA 2, to put it into perspective, it would be like a casual player asking SumaiL to learn how to play whatever hero he's good at from him(I don't know jack about DotA).\n\nThe second time I thought he'd get into shit for his sad behavior, was when he casted a local tournament which goes by the name of "The Eclipse". He hosted the match on his Twitch page and he titled it some random garbage, with no actual attention to who the teams were and a sheer lack of respect, yet again.\n\nProbably not much, but it seems that this wasn't a one-off judging by the experience I've had.\n\nEdit: I was kind of biased towards teatime and ignored his attitude because I felt he was helping the Asian scene and my country in general but in light of recent events and my own personal experience with his behavior I don't think I'll be supporting him unless he has a major attitude overhaul and shows consistency in that regard as well. That being said, I hope this drama helps him reflect on his personality and improve on what he can. The last thing I'd want as a person active in the Pakistani esports scene is for the reputation here to get tainted further.
How to break the fucking defense of techies? EVERY GAME I GO FULL TILT CAUSE OF THIS FUCKER 
git gud
Thanks you three! ?
dota2/comments/lettersnumbers/Why_do_people_hate_Techies_so_much\n\n
I actually feel bad for tea time casting the game to people who take everything he said other than as a joke, Tobi included.
I’m 99% sure that he’s saying “zuck” not “suck”
Followed by 9 reports for the player.
Yeah there's at least a fake album cover hiding there...
OP posted a guide 3 months ago about a new way to grief. If the screenshot is them then we possibly have an inovative greifer with a motive to teach people how to do it too. But regardless 8 years is a bit excessive, I have also heard that its a possible visual bug for 5min queue bans. Note: The guide was removed so people wouldn't abuse it.
It's not me, poor of you Sherlock 
I guessed as much, after I realised it was a screenshot of a screenshot XD
lol now this is some funny shit that  should be on the front page. not that garbage hahAa "THE NEWBEE TWITTER GUY" tweets
formally,it is screen of screen of screen xD
hahaha.. legality aside, if you get in someone's face you better be ready to back it up when you get man handled like a bitch, richard lewis was an ass, but loda was a little bitch.
if cast(Berserker's call)\n\n   then(Tornado)\n
F for Fuck You!
Just a nice guy doing interesting casts who happens to be on the spectrum... I don't know why he gets so much hate 
Other than perhaps the Techies, no one wins in a game with a Techies. All my reports are used on techies, it's the only real toxic shit since they decide from minute 1 that they will ruin the game for everyone else...
nobody actually believes that.  it's like the ultimate troll
Problem? Honestly how many scripters end up in high level games? Very few because dota is a lot more mental than physical after a certain point 
Paging /u/otherjeff_valve\n\n\nWhere's my Pudge Arcana. My wallet is leaking money\n\n\nedit: wew, thanks for the gold!\n
Begone Russki.
It's kind of like how I've never heard someone genuinely say "did you just assume my gender?" un-ironically. \n\nI mean, I may be waaaaaaay off here, but all the hilary and trump memes were being planted by Russia you gotta wonder how far the (rather successful) attempt at disillusion goes. 
That's cute, I played a game where it was 115 minutes long against a techies a couple of night ago. We lost because it was 4v5 and we had to micro our Zeus. 
hej
~~not to play the bagpipe at your circlejerk here but hasnt it occured to you invo might be using hotkeys ? im Pretty sure you can bind any set of key functions to a button [ usualy mouse ] and do stuff like that~~\n\ni have item slot 5,6 and Q,W bound to my mouse button 5 while playing tinker. its a lot faster than using them 1 by 1 Tho it is technicaly Scripts since its a shanky ass app we created but i imagined thats just simplification not cheating\n\n\n\n
[hej](https://i.imgur.com/bbxvMXV.png)
#R-RAP.         BATTLES OF HISTORYYYY
Everything you are talking about is with a coordinated team. If I could control the actions of my team, Id pick Lycan and make them pick death prophet, shadow shaman, dk and a 4 position and just have them fight on one side of the map while the lycan destroys every tower. Probably wouldnt lose a game. BUT I cant control my teammates. If you solo push you usually die unless you are AM, who is terrible right now, because your team isnt pressuring the map, they are fucking jungling because it is the only place safe from techies. 
Yeah it's pretty annoying. I just ban invoker every game now.
Imagine being this retarded 
You know you fucked up when one of the most prominent Dota 2 casters of all time tells you fucked up big time. TrashTime just detonated a nuclear bomb, then threw a meteor strike, then went supernova on his casting career.\n\nHis logic be like "Let's insult one of the most famous names in Dota history and a former TI winner. Oh, his fans are angry? I'm gonna call them stupid. Oh gee, I wonder why these other prominent figures are angry with me?" 
One of the best feelings in the game is reporting the techies and then checking their dotabuff a few days later to see that they're playing ''single draft'' games LUL
And techie players wonder why they keep eating reports.\n\nI love reporting techies and then a couple of days later checking their DB profile to see them playing in low priority. Almost makes up for playing with techies LUL
completly annoying... and btw, need to follow to type in chat is stupid
Obnoxious voice.
Of course he is Russian. The cheaters are ALWAYS Russian or Turkish.
Wow dude will have to wait 8 years to play dota again (le reddit boys are drinking ur tears) ... or just smurf into a new account and get all his items from one account to another... WOW... you guys are stupid
extra mega annoying 
This. Literally makes my ears bleed. Can't stand it.
i script invoker and i'm from new york you racist asshole XD \n:axe_laugh:
Quick delete this beofre EE seeeeees
I love him too man its so funny how he overhype the battle of last hitting creeps, appreciates the detail of how good a player is specially in the laning phase, good stuff in eg optic match
Fuck Ritsu. And grant still grates my ears. Cant wait for another one of his pull a gun out on stream while threatening people antics\n\nEdit: and how much did he pay for these shill acct downvotes?
yah.. whats difference between a macro and script? you push one button and 5 different actions happen
Casting style reminds me of ODPixel which I love. Really enthusiastic and some great humour. 
Exactly, get in someone's face, get ready to to be physically removed
ehemmm, ''He'' was cheating
hehe
Shocker. He is Russian.\nHow do people detect they are cheating though?
Old "perma bans" were listed as [lasting until 2038](http://i.imgur.com/6byyhZT.jpg), due to how 32bit programms function.\n\nIf this was truly a "perma ban", then he would also have it last until 2038, if not even later.\n\nEither way, legit or not, one can easily spoof it via console, so I would take screenshots like this with a grain of salt.\n\n---\n\nThe old ban message also had a horrible time/date format (week day, month, day, time, year).
&gt; '' ≠ "\n\n"quotation mark"
Monka Giga annoying
Just because a better team could avoid the situation doesn't mean worse players should suffer.
Oh, but those are sheep not people ;)
If it was "truly" a perma ban it would just be a perma ban lmao. Just stop dude.
i think this is abit on the right track. what i think is occurring is that some value is changing which (possibly hit variance?) and the creep, that previously wasn't dead, now will be dead.
I literally laughed out loud in my quiet accounting office when mid game 2 he yells 'SLUT KING WITH THE EPICENTER' 
I honestly think any decent-and-up Invoker (at least half of them) are probably cheating.
*eejhis, not egg-iss\n\n*ult, not ultee\n\nWhat do they pay these casters for when they can't get the words right?\n\nEdit: Apparently ya'll motherfuckers need a *dictionary.*
\\`´Am I doing this right?\\`´\n
Why is it always the legion players, man?
&gt;I made a thread about him on Reddit weeks ago
yeah,i meant dusa.
Not an NA thing, I can't stand him man. Just a retard thing 
&gt;russian\n\nFair
&gt;russian\n\nFair
NA fags smh.
You get downvoted but i'm with you dude. Techies pickers ruin the game for the 9 other people in the game. 
&gt;  I've missed funny casts in my life since HuskyStarcraft stopped doing his thing in the SC community\n\nWish modern games had casting like SC2, Artosis, Day9 etc... sadly we have too many fast-talking play-by-play casters who just repeat what is happening in real time that most 3k players can follow.\n\nI also used to dislike grant, but recently his jokes are really witty and enjoyable to listen to.
if this was their best solution, it should have NEVER been shipped. what the fuck????
So like I said it WAS a perma ban lol. What are you going on about then?
I would report you if I was in that game.
Summit? Is that you?!
Lost my shit when I heard this. Have anyone seen it?
ofc it's shit code it's valve.  I wouldn't be surprised if we find out one day at the core of Source 2 is some weird jimmy-rigged super nintendo engine that's been modded to hell
I hate techies
margin-bottom
People use the longer word as the short form, huh? Find me another word that you could possibly confuse "ult" for, and I'll concede. Otherwise, it should be "ult", and even if it was "ulti," it'd be ultih and not ultee.\n\nEdit: It's already in the game in the chatwheel as "Zeus Ult Now!" "Ulti" is junk.
He's a racist dickhead
So?\n\nMaybe its his way of having fun. Who are you to judge?
minus 1 slavtrash.\n\n\n\nday starting well
I mean what small indie company doesn't have spaghetti code. Just look at hearthstone. 
the funny thing is that in 8 years if Dota still exists it will look exactly like his cheats - actual hp and mana numbers, icons to identify if the spells are on cd or not. just read some of the fucktard "quality of life improvement" suggestions that get upvoted here
You realize they do it to make people like you mad right?\n\nI've cheated in games before. It gets boring real fast if its just easy wins. But when someone on the enemy team starts calling you a pathetic virgin you know you've got a reason to continue making them upset.
how lazy do u have to be to make something like this
Valve ought to implement a message on who fucking paused, so you can report that motherfucker when they pause and cause you to miss a fucking last hit.\nBut nooooo, just show a message who unpauses........\nSuch bullshit!
How can you get fucking 8 years ban?\nHow do you even legitimize that Valve?\n\nYou can give someone 8 year ban, but you cant give some1 a fucking possibillity to report fucking techies scripter abusers!\nFucking corrupt Valve company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who the fuck cares. 3k-4k mmr. 
I don't really get how ppl can have fun with techies :/ 
Average russian player, SeemsGood.
SEEYA IN 6 MONTHS KID
I'm a game dev though?
What happened xDDDD
\\&gt;using facebook for messaging
Do you honestly think this is funny?
Russian btw
Then why feed them?
/r/madlads
so what ? do you know jackshit about how servers are handled ? do you know jackshit about how valve's server is handle ? the fact that youre oblivious about what you dont know says a lot about your aptitude as a dev anw (assuming youre saying the truth that is)
Why
Just skip to any time on the vod that's in game and you'll see exactly what I mean
The fact youre assuming what he doesnt know says a lot about how much of an asshole you are. Valve very much could do what was described, even if it is lazy. They were just suggesting what could be happening. For all you know the guy you replied to runs a server. 
&gt;Lion is pausing the game\n\nWhat drugs are you on mate?
I have the same error i cant pos it
Look mom im making him mad, im such le epic trolle XdD\n\nKys
Only someone who never played a single game on PSX would say this.
Great guide! Imo Storm is actually a really strong teamfighter, but just not as the frontliner. I've found it easier to contribute with Storm than Shadow Fiend or even OD for instance, because it's so vital to delete that support from a fight. With other heroes youre more or less limited by your position on the map, but with storm you can blow up one hero and escape while being invulnerable 50% of time. It's very hard to die as Storm!\n\n\nAlso, zipping in to kill the back line in a fight will draw so much attention that either you or your carry will be able to inflict massive damage, unlike many combos of pos 1 and 2 where in fights they basically take up similar positions: somewhat in front or maybe behind the pos 3, dealing damage. Storm allows you to fight on two fronts.
remove hero.
It's own wae
Not sure have you noticed, but you're a russian. Getting banned is in your blood
What ever happened to "don't feed the trolls"?\nYou and others like you are literally the reason most cheaters exist.\n\nNobody cares when some mad guy on the internet insults them. It just shows them that they're winning.
Show me dey wey
Nice to see that he understood what TeaTime said
both of them are faggots,no one gives a fuck smh
What's drama all about?   \n  \nYes TeaTime is shit caster, but he told truth, bulldog did not play competitive dota for 2 years, currently he is not at high level like pro players and that's it.    \n"But yep, i luv buldawg i can't take it i'll go make reddit thread because i'm 12."  \n  \nAnd you define it as "flaming", do you know what flaming is? If he said something like: "Bulldog is shit player, he does not belong in dota scene bla bla." That's flaming. But saying that someone is not on pro level like he used to be because he had not played pro dota for 2 years is not flaming lol, it's fact..  \n   \nHe is like Ronaldinho right now, at his prime time he was sick player, but right now he is just "celebrity" as this guy mentioned, he plays at charity events and so on.
It also gave you 94 gold which is alot more then it should give.
He misses tons of details.
Me too. Laptop gaming steady 30fps. If my fps was higher im sure I would be Divine 5 easy. 
They report you for playing good, they report you for playing bad.\n\nThey report you for being the nice guy, they report you for being the bad one.\n\nExcessive reports would lead to 6 months ban.\n\nSo in due time, we will all be banned for 6 months!
Learn to accept truth, it will be usefull in your life.
My bad. When I wrote that I had in mind "the short zips just to proc overload" these zips usually happen after the long zip to close distance. Of course if it's a long zip then you always want to zip behind the enemy because your attack would come out midflight.\n\nSoz I should have made that clearer 
Did bulldog just sounds like he's sobbing? Hmm
There is also no time for storm to attack midflight during the short zips hence you only get to attack after the zip. Having to turn to attack is less efficient imo
Yes his job is to cast the match, that's why for example GranDGranT talk stories about walmart..
Still accept truth.
PepeHands
hes such a damn beta
You're acting like English is easy to learn. Especially coming from a language that share virtually no similarities in word structure.
memes for life &lt;3
I'm curious, how old are you?
go work a week at McD's then, you don't need to spend $1000 on a 1080ti to run this game at 60fps.
I instantly looked at his gold too and saw this. He basically got two cs instead of one.\n\nCould it actually be, that he got two cs off of one creep, because the pause happened at the exact server tick he would be credited with it, so he gets it once when the pause happens (but his client has not updated yet) and once, when the server updates due to the level up?
Pretty hard to time it, when pauses take 3 seconds in online matches before they take effect.\n\n
Valve limits reports so that they aren't abused too readily.\n\nBut you know what's a  real problem? Negative Behavior Score inflation.\n\nEspecially in low population regions.\n\nAs time goes on reported profiling builds up and behavior scores drop overall very steadily. (Meaning reports count more and you inch towards LP and bans without any perceivable change in true overall player behavior).\n\nRemember when Valve reset behavior score before last patch?\n\nYeah.\n\n\n\nPeople thought it was Valve being lenient, or a fresh start.\n\nNO! Fools, it was Valve anticipating Behavior Score inflation.\nSo they admit to the flaws in their own system.\n\nThis doesnt address the central issue. Which can be fixed.\n\nValve treat their customers like a cattle farm.\nWant to know why Valve hardly communicates with the playerbase?\n\nBecause you don't talk to cattle.
Got thrown into low-priority because my ideal ability line-up got completely denied, and I'm only left with skills combination that cancel off each another, while the enemies on my lane got a full nuke abilities and nuke me to death... Reported when I'm not even playing normal All Pick nor Ranked match......
WTF is goreng pisang, it is completely different pisang goreng....  Pisang goreng is the food (fried banana)  and goreng pisang would be (fry a banana or something) 
That's not how languages work. It's easy if you already know/speak a language that is related. Not if you are trying to go from say, English to Arabic. Russian and English are significantly different.
My family are Swedish immigrants, I know some Swedish. 
What a great system, community reporting with 0 moderation. Just keep your head down and don't talk so you don't banned because you triggered someone's ego. Don't attract attention to yourself, don't pick cores and only build recommended items.\n\ne: to the downvoters, ask yourself whether you would like this system anywhere else. Youtube comments, reddit, facebook? Banned for saying something controversial. I would probably get a ban for this comment if this was up to you. Twitch streamers would not exist as everybody would be banned based on trolls in the chat. But hey, it's perfect in dota, since the community is infallible.
bulba shitter OMEGALUL
Your willful ignorance is distasteful.\n\nKys
Yes their personal hate/arrogance aside, what is wrong in sentence that he said?  \n  \nBulldog played  bad that game, puck is not his hero, he missed a lot his spells and had bad positioning, and at this point he is actually just celebrity and because of his previous reputation they invited him as standin. They could find better standin that play at pro level, but they decided not to. And even bulldog admits that in video above.
it's in my posts
Typical Russian behaviour
nope, it can be a tipping point though
by your logic every caster is unprofessional.coz i have seen every1 caster like tobi od etc talk about stuff outside game when there is no action in the game/you may as well flame them if you are gng into that territory
here we go , fucking reddit circlejerk
here we go , fucking reddit circlejerk
Can valve fix the matchmaking? Last time I played someone picked invoker got owned in mid lane then quits, a fucking average crusader 4 ranked SEA server. WHO DOES THAT?!
Yeah, surprisingly someone who is self-aware and not an absolutely idiotic wannabe can admit that he's shit in competitive. LOL let me send him another 5 bucks for a funny meymey lollozrofl.
OPFrog\n
Now if he could only win a minor, major or get top 4 at TI.
it is indeed
That makes sense 
PepeHands IRL
Balance in all things ?
Yeah actual quality caster unlike someone recently getting spotlight for being total shit tier. Teatimelul
Na listen to it again, what he said in the cast went way past all that. 
nigga u retarded
There're arguments both ways for this. We know this is true because people are getting LP for being bitches chat, no comms ban and no abuse. It took the ripe old age of 7.07 for them to claim detection is being implemented to a very limited degree for a very narrow offense. So what about before then?\n\nValve would never lie, would they?\nOfc they wouldn't. White lies aren't lies.
&gt;runs a server\n\nwhat a weird benchmark to place for having an understanding of netcode lmao. I'll call up the teenager who runs my nephew's Minecraft server, that'll get this bug fixed right quick
Hey, are you Sven? Because you have a Great Cleave(age).\n(assuming your bf have manboobs) 
example of why invoker is a joke hero\n\n
You got owned and you are acting like a complete retard. Just stop.
Admiral bulldog is always right because he is a ti winner( math doesn't count)
Perhaps he just needs to find an analytical caster he has good chemistry with because you are right, stats and facts are not his strong suit. He can still learn. There are many people in the scene who started with the wrong attitude. Hell, even Toby had his moments back in the day. There used to be a hate-train for him too because of attitude. People grow (up) when given the chance and the time.
what's that music player he is using??? Spotify makes my dota2 match lag
That makes sense 
This is what I call solo-carried the game. \n\nJust casually walking up to highground against four enemies, activating BKB and killing 'em all. That was hilarious and orgasmic at the same time! It's like when your girlfriend giggles during her climax and you're like 'Wut?'. 
Works fine for me
PepeHands
I can give you a lot of arguments for why it specifically isn't, but all of us can agree that the scenario you describe happens a lot and is unwanted.\n\nThen yes, the system is flawed and needs to be fixed. Good news is it can be fixed. Bad news is it's Valve and they can't be bothered.
Thanks for this man. Brief and informative!\n\nEdit: downvoted why?
Okey guys.\nWe have next:\n\n*  Ppl stil thinks its me.\n\n* Russians are bad ( CIS includes )\n\n* EU top ladder full of CIS playes.\n95% of commentators is lower than me.\nP.S. imnot  ancient 4 lmao \n
I almost always get a LP after a losing streak, and those happen about 1-2 times a week. I'm pretty scared myself. I usually play cores and I should probably move to support because they get reported way less in losing games.
Also completely common courtesy to join a game with 9 other people fully knowing you need to leave for 20 minutes soon after it starts. Why am *I* supposed to be the bad guy if I continue?
No, that's just a fact. The harsh punishment for griefers is fine. The problem is that it's the community who decides who gets punished.\n\nRemember the Aziz Ansari outrage? Or the Boston Bomber &amp; reddit investigators? That's what you get when you give the power to the community. No due process, just pointing fingers and knee-jerk reactions.\n\nNow take that knee-jerk reaction and put it into a game where people always try to find a scapegoat for their own mistakes and misplays and give them the power to punish you for nothing. Or hell, even punish you for playing badly. But hey, reddit circlejerk right? Thank god you're not a redditor.\n\nI like to communicate in games and talk strategy in the drafting phase and some people tell me they muted me when I've said 0 insults or criticism, I just suggested what we could pick or what counters enemy heroes. Some people don't give a shit about communicating and these people have the right to decide who gets punished simply based on the fact they don't like you.\n\nLast pick random? That guy can report you. First pick antimage? He also has a report right. Jungle LC? That's 3 reports from this brilliant example of virtue and just judgment.\n\nIt's a flawed system. I'm not saying only innocent people get punished. I'm saying it's just a bit too imperfect given how easy it is to report someone for nothing and how harsh the punishment can be.
Wow, thats actually so petty. "can't beat them so we'll block them and act like they don't exist"\n\nSo pathetic.
your parents money*
stop lying
So beautiful!.\n\n\nI.......came!!!
If you agree that pausing is a courtesy, why would you report someone who unpause? Do you also report your support that didn't give you tango? 
Is it safe to say that EE is the best TB player in the world? 
That's actually an anti span measure, has nothing to do with DotA2. When a certain message is being sent from/to many people they will block it
It doesn't work with many streaming services. Also porn websites.
playing against tier 3 teams? uhm probably\n\nplaying against legit teams? Hell no. Envy with TB shat himself against VG
You forgot Loda and Yaphets. They are the best TB players /s
OP is one ugly bitch, who needs reddit to help with pick-up lines. gtfo
&gt; I like to communicate in games and talk strategy in the drafting phase and some people tell me they muted me when I've said 0 insults or criticism, I just suggested what we could pick or what counters enemy heroes. Some people don't give a shit about communicating and these people have the right to decide who gets punished simply based on the fact they don't like you.  \n  \nThis is so true in my 4k bracket SEA server. 
Can anyone explain to me why fnatic put the Terrorblade mid and the OD bot in game 2? It almost cost them the game and I was baffled for ages trying to figure out why they didn't just put OD mid and Terrorblade in a side lane.
https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3696802285\n\nYou mean this game? EE had close to 30k damage, and was the only reason why Fnatic were still in it. Abed had a shocking Invoker game, got picked off twice in a row and then Fnatic lost. If anyone shat himself, it was Abed. 
IS SO WHAT?! 
The game turned around after EE bought sb + orchid. He was the mvp this game. Abed got EE's usual role of playing the hard lane. At least he now understand how EE feels. The doujinshis are probably writing themselves by now.
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted, but it’s totally true.\n\nGoreng pisang = action (goreng as a verb) where you fry the banana\nPisang goreng = a fried banana (goreng as an adjective)
I miss the old Artour
Stop this wEEbnEEss!
Don't think anyone is tbh. Going in with low expectations from Fnatic this series, hope they can be competitive at least
u/DEjeynes with a protective EE comment again. 
You're allowed to admit that EE TB is legit. Won't kill you. 
ANELE Clap
hontrash vs hontrash lets go
I mean that's EE fangays for you. If they stop praising EE like his a tier 1 player, maybe he will really try to improve but you get things like this.. Best TB after watching EE beat tier 3 teams :wutface:
it does though, pub culture is vastly different\n\nNA teams also favor braindead heroes like abbadon, but import EU players to play po4 because no one in north america is smart enough to play earth spirit
wtf with that war
More like 202, cos that's "accepted" http status, but I have no idea why one would block it. But I'm not pro in web pages, so it might be reasonable to do so. Someone more versed might chip in to enlighten us : D
Sorry for noob question, why us tb good against timber ?
Lmao, I'm only praising his TB here. Plus he has always played well on it since the hero was first added. 
yeah prestun + sunstrike ganks without leaving the lane are super useless.
This.
The person that dares to tell the truth is called a lunatic and a fool. You will be hated by the crowd. -ferari420blazeit \n\njokes aside I'm not here for the drama just want to meme. 
Sorry, I forgot to ask some random retarded piece of shit what to do.
Bulldog is so funny haHAA \n\nConstantly saying which emote should chat spam like I am 12 yo haHAA\n\nOh, that's a ban haHAA\n\nTI-Eye winner btw haHAA\n\nFucking cringefiesta, I was in love with his stream year ago, but then he started to be more and more cringe (I know, some of it is intentional, but far beyond line of adequacy), breaking point was where he constantly fed and ruined the game on Magnus for Noone. \nI realized that his jokes are aimed on kids, his performance is not good, so, what's the point?\n\nAnd I am not even talking about 70% of Twitch memes that were stolen from Forsen's stream.\n\nI know, I will recieve a lot of hate for this, but for me his stream is dead.\n\nMaybe I am just triggered retard, meh :/
Get a life kid 
Man, w33ha just destroyed this team's synergy.
I hope your dota is better than your reading comprehension, cuz that one is Herald rank
Alliance   PepeHands\n
Or just read the explanation in the comments before creating drama for no reason.
Why do you care so much
It's not just preference, not any more than saying "nook-yu-lur" is preference over saying "nu-klee-ar" or "ek-set-era" over "et-set-era" is. There's saying "ult" and then there's saying something incorrectly. But all I'm doing is correcting the error, I'm not flaming anyone. These people get paid (presumably) to speak over exciting gameplay, the least they could do is bother to get it right.
using facebook in 2018; lul; 
Get cancer and die, just like your whore mom did.
And raven played it in TIs and EE's TB wins was pulled from what? thats right, shit tier teams. He is a good dota player but the best TB? Wipe EE's juice out from your face to see things clearly boy. 
means you need to surrender yourself to the twitch chat zombies.
Just go for OD pixel man, ODP sounds pretty painful ? 
Most people would hop and twitter and get all pissy. I bet I would have milked it for all the sympathy and goodwill I could and just looked like a bitch. I don't know why people are calling him a cuck, it's an alpha thing to do to just brush it off and make a joke out of it, now people will love him even more.
X Doubt \n\nFirst paragraph seems fine. Then an immediate Tiny reference aaaand "put out"\nWho knows a woman that talks like that.. Oh wait, wrong sub?
If that guy from yesterday that caused all of these nerds to have mass panic attacks had said this they’d be bitching and moaning so hard over it
That's what I like about bdog even though I can't catch his stream nowadays I still watch clips on YouTube.
last time i checked they also messed with some google drive or google photos links
It's also an Indonesian dessert
They need to fucking give back dispel to  diffusal. Omni is fucking becoming a cancer.
FeelsOkayMan
I'm so done with Universe lol just retire alrdy
Lmao, you can literally look through Raven's TB games if you want. Lost against a whole lot of "shit tier" SEA teams.
universe is playing incredibly bad, misplaying basically everything and i couldnt be happier, poor ohaiyo
it is not about pissed,i just want to complaint about my honest opinion about pisang goreng and goreng pisang is completely different
Nah, they would find something more interesting and profitable first before claiming it as theirs. Pisang goreng is meh. 
&gt;  you really think they are doing it to stop people from using a competitor? \n\nHe didn't say that. Read context, notice that's neither what he said nor what was said in this particular chain. You're putting words in his mouth. He didn't say that, and the people he replied to didn't say it.\n\nAnd don't say but someone else in some other chain did. It doesn't excuse putting the words in this guys mouth. Go reply to the guy who ACTUALLY commented on competition (except oh wait, even he didn't say steam was doing it to squelch competition. So even then your made up argument you just attacked was ENTIRELY MADE UP AND **NO ONE** STATED, let alone the guy you replied to)
Stop writing guides pls ur missleading people.
Well, now we can see =)
I wasn't trying to put words in anyone's mouth. That's just why Facebook does it so I made that leap myself
I’m Fucking dead ?
Ranking up skills and using them in the heat of battle is something that shouldn't be made easier by a pause...\n\nI dont like this change.
I play with enemy chat off and if an enemy pauses and no one is dced/dcs within a couple seconds I unpause. You'd report me for that?
&gt; you really think they are doing it to stop people from using a competitor? \n\nSo that's your way of stating "that is exactly why I think Facebook does it"? And that somehow makes it an appropriate reply to the guy who was talking about STEAM, NOT FACEBOOK? Not any of the people actually directly talking about facebook?\n\nWow, that's some impressively BAD backpedaling. \n\nAgain, please learn how forums and context work. Hit "reply" to what you're REPLYING TO. Not other comments.
Does it also block url shorteners?  \nIf not just use things like tinyurl to hide the link.\n
&gt; here we go , fucking reddit circlejerk\n\nIronic comment from an idiot without an original thought about the matter
Give it purge and make it cost like 500 more or something.
I hope you're okay dude. If you ever need anyone feel free to pm. 
!RemindMe to fuck your girlfriend
"EE is the best TB player in the world" haHaHAH
I think TeamTime wasn't even trying to insult Bulldog, he was trying to meme. You know, be edgy, flamey, salty. Depending on who does it this community loves it, but since he's not one of these kid's favorite personalities they took issue with it.
armpit
Yeah I mean they only have different haircuts, different ears, different eyebrows, different eyes, different cheeks, mouths, facial shape and necks. Beside that and the beard though they are very similar 
And this is why, only playing like crazy vs having a balanced life, balanced life will allways win-
Oh, white knight of reddit. I was wondering, when those virgin nerds are going to come out of their holes. And here you are.
lmao, what a useless rapier gyro
Miracle- TB vs LFY in TI7 was a top terrorblade performance. Any similar play by the pros pops your mind?
bs guide. Wrong information everywhere. Please stop writing guide.
Nice call XD
Well ok that was pretty bad.
Ya all licked ee’s ass when they faced tier 3 team now lick his loser ass now ????
I don't see any dominant from Abed, he's straight getting outplay in every scenario, can't believe he's a 10k player
I would imagine they would just change it back the the 8 charge deal.
What does a game where EE did not play TB have to do with that statement?
make GTG for new meme...
Theonly reason they even had a slight chance in this game was him and lion. TNC just ran over the abed
Abed invoker against tier 3 team PogChamp Abed invoker against tier 1.5 team Lul
Ee holding him back. You cant blame him its invker wont activte until 15 mins
If only EE understand that the best teams in the world has a pos 5 captain / drafter... his drafts are so bad.
LOL what? "Advance" (*sic*) guide that has like half of it flat out wrong regarding when to and not to attack and whether let it be autoattack; therefore, a good chunk of it could be reduced to this paragraph and be done with:\n\n1. Analyze the situation and pick your target.\n2. Using the mouse, move the pointer to the chosen target.\n3. Right click.\n4. Profit!\n\nSince the hero functions normally during Ball Lighting, it can cast and attack during it, you just control *what* will it attack instead of letting it waste Overload charge on something else. Also, NOTHING can make a unit **next** attack slower or faster after it went on cooldown. Doing short zips won't let you attack any faster than attacking as usual. Now, I don't know whether he got that the hero has two different attack animations right, but I know that it yet again makes no difference on the overall attack rate, since, unlike abilities, that only have cast point defined for them, attacks have in addition to attack point a dynamic duration that is determined by a formula, with base attack time being the starting limit, further adjusted by increased attack speed. You also didn't tell a pretty big thing, that Overload can be applied to already in-flight attacks any time before they hit.
I have the suspicion it is because I would rather farm and split push than join a fight that looks lost. And when a game is not going well, it usually means that most 5v5 fights would be lost, so I spend a lot of time away from my team and get pinged a lot when they take a 4v5 fight and die.
That's my point. There are 200000 TB players out there who are definitely better than your anime protagonist.
TL;DR version: Farm, gank, split push, gank, teamfight, gank, and don't die too much.
#fuckteatime boysh
You either die a miracle, or live long enough to see yourself become an rtz
Poor guy must be thinking now why the hell did I say that, don't be so hard on him, he maybe even doesn't think that, he only wanted to be cool :(, we all make mistakes
What if TNC get Abed instead of Armel?
That's what you get for an idiotic axe 2nd pick
Era's team is actually winning games what the fuck is wrong with the skill level in EU qualifiers right now
Players tend to leave EG and do fuck all in their new teams. I think that says something about EG's core group and their value added. EE and Universe look like trash.
Tbh eu dota professionals are probably more toxic than na at this point
I'd give EE some credit for the shot calls, and the early aggression they had with the Lion + Gyro combo.
There is definitely a correlation in my games. There might very well be some personal factor that causes that correlation for me and isn't present for others though.
In the Netherlands most Chinese restaurants are Chinese/Indo mix. And the best part is easily pisang goreng. It's so fucking good.
He doesn't take himself seriously. So if *you* take him seriously you're gonna have a bad time. Grant is definitely an acquired taste - once you tune into his wavelength it's a great time.
hoping a comeback  \n  \ntnc just got ee's number
It's not respect as much as knowing he has an extremely limited hero pool. It's smart to ban out a players hero's that has limited versatility so he winds up on hero's he can't really play at all or not well. Nice guy for standing in though. 
not long ago SEA thread was graveyard,and then EE came what an impact
I'd rather give someone else who isn't a prick a chance at being a caster.
why the fuck would they try to find out if twitch works on fb if their stream is to be on fb ? are you fucking stupid ?
You sound like a stalker, and you’re making an ad hominem argument 
Alliance drafts are so damn greedy 
universe couldn't fucking get a decent call from all the anti axe spells. exorcism, silence deathward, mal edict, reflection, ravage, scorched earth. It had everything to do with the draft to pick an axe 2nd. He got countered hard herowise. But of course, an impotent hero on universe that hasn't been used in pro games for a loooooooong time gfor good reason gets second picked and blame the player holding him for bad play. LOL. 
Thank god you have that flair, otherwise saying stupid shit would be a suprise.
LMAO
End here we how smart EE fans are lul. You guys cant even get the context of what happened why axe was having a hard time
Why the fuck are you always in every thread about bans
No shit sherlock, but as I said before, the +80 damage lets you move around the map faster which makes it harder for you to catch. If you get caught as a storm you're often dead anyway if they have heroes to deal with you. Because you move around the map faster it's difficult to quantify how much one or the other talent would help, sometimes +300 health will save you, other times it won't but you probably shouldn't be getting caught as a storm pushing 1/2 waves anyway.
EE and FATA look like trash..I wonder who's the real problem here..
And yet you are replying xD. Fucking retard.
Thank god you're so biased that you think anything outside of OG in these qualifiers is worth watching.  I at least get some joy out of EG, coL and Optic in NA.
lmao
Yeah you have the joy of watching all your teams playing qualifiers because none of them is worth an invite, that shows how good that region is, and don't worry lans are coming up, let's see how CoL and OpTic get last place on them, like always.
Wow EE and Universe + DJ just dumpstered the EE haters.\n\nTNC got completely rekt by that Genius Razor + Enigma.
lmao what the F are you talking about
TNC just got dumpstered.
*triggered*
here comes EE dick sucking weebs. lul
Tuck Finker.
this post again
What's the worst feeling? \n"Basically my life"\n\nComment history checks out
unless the jokes are about him
No they wonned it by an big margin.
Why do people care about caster bias? Who cares who the caster wants to win?\n\nVin Scully casted the LA Dodgers for 67 seasons. He liked the Dodgers. No one cared. 
Sure but he had no other item he might be using other than treads.
tru dat
I dont really like Bulldogs normal on-stream humour and how his running gags make their way into every reddit thread.\n\nYour comment is still unnecessary and your edit is pathetic.
lol
maybe dendi is just frustrated after all those years that he wants to captain the team? I am not sure if hes 100% captain tho, i still havent finished watching interview
LLULDA?
probably viewbots
ugh I thought the meme of upvoting mspaint stuff to the front page was over.
Tbh this should be how things go, if it was a professional cast about sports that I'm watching on TV I would've probably changed the channel when I hear someone bitching, like I'm here to have a good time not to listen to someone complaining about this or that because he's been hurt before, I'm not his mom or dad what's the use complaining about people to me ?\n\n\nEdit: It might come as confusing but I was agreeing with Bulldog's attitude. I was talking about the other caster who flamed him.
most of those were online relationships, its whatever. but the sinned one was weird. it was obvious she had another guy on the side by the time they "broke up"
If this keeps going were gonna have maut +teatime casting TI finals monkaS
Is he? This clip was funny, but Bulldog's humour is 100% nothing to boast about in general.
xyclopz and llama semifinal\n\nNahaz host

New Navi TI8 strat
Alliance is .....?
Yeah this post was funny. I laughed. But I see so many posts about caster bias. Is that actually a thing people care about or just a meme? 
&gt;Nahaz host  \n\nAyesee at the analyst desk 
I don't know if it takes much wit to keep spouting the same phrases and memes over and over again on every stream. Shouting into the microphone and thinking it's funny is also some 4th grader shit man
Even pros mess up sometimes
What is joke?
No matter how good Lil will be dont forget that NaVi is still meh and he cant carry all of them. 
Failing win a qualifier =/= losing a game \n\n
Lol
I know Maut isn’t the most favored caster but it’s uncalled for to put that idiot as a comparison to Maut
lil is a meme man.
I don't think that's how you use the word "either", buddy 
From a noobfromua compile i saw, lil was not very good, individual skill wise at least. Needs to work more and find his place on the team.
He made some pretty trash plays on that game with doom, nothing teamwork related, not even mediocre play just plain trash. Downvote if you will I'm happy his daazle has something great to show for, but he needs more than that to recover his status.
&gt; I am continuing to be a dota 2 personality\n\nReading comprehension please.
Good
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan to back up my back up plan.\n\nSeriously though... can you explain to me what wasting your time actually means?
I think its all because of rodjer, people just dont realize how much of a contribution he brought to navi, he was their most important player and there is a reason why VP, 3rd best team at the moment wanted him in his roster.\n\nThats just my opinion
Jebaited
This is actually kind of fucking rude of Slacks. Merlini just spilled his life out for us, and explained how sad he is about leaving and this guy makes a "joking" post about not leaving.\n\nBlows my mind how literally any 2k player could do what Slacks is doing yet he is the one who made it xD\n\nMaybe I am salty, and I am sure this post will get down voted and get hated, trolled, tell me I am jealous, etc. 
Sorry 1.5k \n\nDidn't mean to shoot high!
I don't understand why you call it vote manipulation. Did he pay you ? Or hacked into the website ?\n\nHe was literally campaigning and asking the people he knows to vote for him. Like everyone ever for a vote of pretty much any kind.\n\nIn every single TV shows where vote is used to decide the winner, the community of people who is barely related to the candidate (from the same city, etc) will massively vote for him.\n\nIt's pretty much the same here.\n\nWe should just stop trying to overthink this. He fucked up like anyone can fuck up. It's just how it is. He will have to pay for his mistakes and try to rebuild after it.\n\nJust move on guys.
You realize he said he was continuing

Have you guys even read his tweet?
? hello?
OMEGALUL
hahaha yah RIP Tucker\n
What I don’t get is there are 3.5k Divine5, meanwhile RTZ is a Divine5....wtf?
Probably they’re divine in either solo or party rank. 
Is it really vote manipulation in a popularity contest if you just say "hey buds vote for me in this thing im doing". 
that was just for upper ranks, 2k now is the same as 2k before. Still a great milestone!

NIG
[How to look like an idiot in front of the whole subreddit.](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/68186278/matches?hero=omniknight&amp;enhance=overview)\n\n**Edit for the dumb ones:** He has't played Omniknight for 2 months now, so the joke is completely irrelevant.
well I am above 2k, and I told you I am salty, jealous, etc.\n\nI was just mainly saying he is nothing special, and his remark/tweet was quite rude and I wouldn't be fond of it if I was a "friend" of his.
&gt;Is there a gay league of legends\n\nYeah, we call it Dota
GER
fk that guy , ya'll get our pitchforks out and make sure he never comes back to cast dota
&gt; best gachi\n\nI don't understand
From a NaVi insider, believe me all what Dendi wanted is captening. Some people are acting as if Dendi is the poor guy there, if you really knew what Dendi is doing behind the scene, I can assure you, you will never support him again. Let's just say he is the main reason most players leaves NaVi after a while. I know my comment will be downvoted to hell but whatever, I just wanted to throw that out there even if it only shows one person that Dendi isn't really the good guy everyone thinks he is. 
So, you're telling me that you have no casters or whatever you want to call Slacks that you don't agree with or dislike entirely?\n\nLord, kiddo.
funniest part about this thread is that this is a low priority game (which op conveniently doesn't mention, yet he mentions a "top 200 player") and op is a serial game ruiner lmao\n\nhttps://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3733275110 (op is magnus)
This is a bit ridiculous tbh. One thing to go on him for his poor reaction on Bulldog and his PR reaction which was awful, another to call on vote manipulation when it's not. That's fair play. You do what you can do get your name knows, and that start by friends, network, anyway you can. Don't be naive.\n\n&gt;Secondly (and this is what really rankles me) there are far better casters there who had their chance stolen who had been working hard for quite some time. I know Dota players (actual ones) are introvert and many are not active on FB. I consider this a stolen chance for them.\n\nYou are making assumptions. On him not working hard or not on Dota, on dota player being introvert who deserve more and on a lot more stuff. And anyway, like I said, you got to do whatever you can to make up your brand and get known.\n\n&gt;You guys deserve transparency on this issue and information what .you chose to do with it is up to you.\n\nYou really believe yourself when you type that ? Genuinely asking.\n\nI don't know this guy but like pretty much everybody here, I was not a fan of his flaming of Bulldog, nor his reaction to the whole mess, to me he basically ruined his chances in the next few months to cast anything dota-related for now. He doesn't have anything special in his cast, not an awful nor great voice, it was okayish at best. But cut him some slack, this is getting kinda silly tbh.\n&gt;And lastly he’s just an impressionable college going youth who made a mistake cut him some slack.\n\nLmao really, after all the stuff you just wrote. Alright if you got some issues with this guy, you don't need to hide yourself behind the self-righteous idea of bringing the ''truth'' to the ''brotherhood'', I don't know man, that's pretty bs to say that after the whole post being written in a certain way.\n\nBtw, a poll on Twitch or on Reddit would have bring other issues too.\n\n/peace ^nothingagainstyouplsdontmakemecommitseppuku 
I would like to take a moment to correctly point out that this "meme" is cringey. Thank you for your time.
let it die and fuck off
This is not vote manipulating holy shit you guys are fuckin dumb.
&gt;Vote manipulation lead to worlds shittest cast.\n\nBullshit dude. This is not vote manipulation, this is popularity contest. And it was just 40 votes as you said, that is nothing.\n\n&gt;Many more deserving casters had their chance stolen.\n\nSeven other commentators were chosen to cast the closed qualifiers, how is this stealing anyone's chance?\n\nYou just sound like a butthurt whiny idiot at this point.
is this a meme I've never seen before
&gt;so he must be doing something right \n\nOr his demographic consists of 12 year olds so he doesn't need to actually put in any effort
Oh no, fat retarded idiot won't quit :(
Talk about backstabbing someone for internet karma.\n\nHope life teaches better
Someone's jealous lmao.\n\nAnyways; vote shilling is exactly what every "popularity" contest means.
That was the worst twitch chat I have ever seen. No one was watching the game and they were spamming the same meme over and over without even a hint of variation (and without it getting funnier...)\nNo one listened to the casters though they did fine (shoutout to breakyCPK and rawdota).\nI hope this is not what twitch chat has become
:(
There is no high horse. I question anyone's mental health if you're over 20 and watch bulldog's stream. His humour is literally 1:1 made for prepubescents.\n\nITT: bulldog fans. I encourage yall to show bulldog's stream to any of your friends and family and if they don't think you're borderline retarded, I'll be impressed
Threatening the organization, apparently he has enough money to continue his life so he does not care anymore. He fought with Pajkatt 24/7, he was like "either u give me what I want on mid or I won't be playing". He threatens everyone, he wants to captain and he does not want anyone arguing with him. Heck, even NaVi owners were like "you should fucking stop that or to hell with you". Problem is, dota fans never looks to whats going on behind the scene, the only constant member of a failing NaVi squad for the past years was Dendi, this should tell you something, no? Dota fans just loves him too much, and that's why NaVi can't afford to lose him and are always doing whatever he wants. But believe me, he is far far far from being even close to a good person inside the team. In real life he is nice and fun and all but inside NaVi organization he is the worst human being.
When you replace Matic with Bakayoko cmonBruh
what the fuck did i click on
Maybe its his way of having fun? Who are you to judge?\nI see people going junlge with LC and i don't make threads about it even though it ruins the game from the start.\n\nYou know why? Because it's just a video game and caring about such shit is dumb. Grow the fuck up.\n\nIts valve fault for not having a decent anti-cheat system in the first place. \n\nAlso nice witchhunt btw.
Bruh, geosync orbits? It's like turning 360 and walking away?
What's so bad about this? Incentivizing people to vote for you is common practice in pretty much any vote, and not just on the internet. It just shows dedication and that leads people to get their lazy asses over to the site and vote. Also he seemed to be polite asking if could plug his vote into the group.\n\nThe people in the second pic could just be friends and family that just want to help out. Remember that that's happened with FYM Hot Sauce and the alleged "spamming advertisements".\n\nOnly thing OP is right about is that the blame is not on TeaTime, but on the organizers who didn't publicize their vote that was apparently so important for the competition. Pretty sure that many actual interested Dota players didn't even know it existed.\n\nThe rest of his post is just riding the hatetrain against TeaTime and calling what he did "vote manipulation" is unfair and disgusting.
Pls guys dont forget you talking about an existing human beeing with feelings and stuff... This hate is way to much for the "things" he did\n
The thing is, he doesn't suited to be one. Not only he has to play mid (which is the most technical position in the game), but he also doesn't have the firm power of Artstyle and Solo, the fire breathing intimidating power of Puppey or the ice cold clean cut calculated style of Kuroky and PPD to be one. A leader has to have sth to lead.
When does this classify as witch hunt?
ya'll = ya will\n\ny'all = you all
It's still super fucking stupid. You can retake your finals 2-3 months later, but I don't know how often people will just offer to take you across the world for free.
I really like Dendi, he was the first dota personality i got to know and ive been a navi fanboy ever since ti2. \nI cant say that i believe you even 50% but i can see that something is definitely wrong inside NaVi and it might even be dendi himself. At least what you said abou him not caring can be seen in the past videos, for example the one with patch questions. Everyone answered as best they could and dendi was sitting there with kinda fake smile and "pls leave me alone" look in his eyes. \n\n\nAll in all, If you somehow can get any proof of that, maybe convince your contacts from org to leak something you'll be a legend.
qop looks exceptionally juicy 
BibleThump (༼☯﹏☯༽)
Snith is fucking retarded and annoying. Alice is a loud mouthbreather with an annoying laugh. Both cannot really even play the game, and both make the stream unwatchable.
Sing was more annoying with his "WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE FISH???? HERE'S ALL THE ASIAN FOOD I LIKE OH YOU DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU".
bruh this comment made me remember Devilman Crybaby :(
this guy is retarded anyways 
Im saying Bakayoko because he colored his hair blue (Chelsea color), just like Lil to yellow (NaVi color) :D 
Costa performed really good first year under Mou, after that he kinda went too crazy
I like how Lanaya is invisible and trembling cause of the tension between the Magic user and the Anti-Magic guy LUL
Let me take a guess; he's russian.
well, its kinda different than that TeaTime shit
He still plays on his account almost every day.
On US East?
Playing since 2015 and you are only 2k? Holy shit you are fucking bad.
You can see his activity.
My boi.
Activity.
Is banning as per mobo serial number possible?
Every other team plays as 5,na'vi play as 1+1+1+1+1. smh weak teamplay
Yes traveling for a week is totally prioritizing it over education. I've missed finals for traveling, still graduated with an excellent grade. So I guess "Why not both?"
Well, ideally the "campaign" is targeted towards a relevant audience. It's not against the rules to ask other people to vote too, but it might be unethical at a certain level. \n\nRegardless, it's of course the organizers who has the main responsibility to ensure contest hits the relevant people. And if enough regular viewers had voted, this "loophole" wouldn't be so easily exploited in the first place, be that "accidental" or on purpose.
Waaaat xD
2k is too much, any person with half a brain can do what Slacks is doing.
Cancer thumbnail + Russian, not watching this shit.
Never mentioned that its mine bro. Just saw it on facebook and just wanted to share. :) 
And?
No it isnt, and stop advocated for what you don't understand.\n\nHe can just spoof his hardware ID.\n\n"IP ban" doesn't do anything when the majority of people have a dynamic IP address. \n\nValve would need to ban a whole range of IP addresses, which again, would be completed retarded as he would just spoof his IP address and then everybody on that range would get banned for nothing.\n\nYes, downvote me for correct you because you advocate for something that you don't know how it works. Inform yourself.
Maybe it's like a rich kid who plays dota and doesn't actually give a fuck about his account.
So what is the best then? I am not into software/hardware that much.
No! Not the soulring! I just can't handle scripters who soulring without looking at themselves!
Actually if sth lasts 10 secs and happened with 0.1 sec intervals , this thing happens 101 times.\n\nThink that you have 100 interval, that means you have 101 stuff.
You are gay.
We really don't care, can you stop posting these shit ass fuck threads?
Ar1se just had some tasty SEA drama, go google it if you like :)
He is a fraud
i know hes worst, but stiches. always the bitches
Go fuckyourself. Dota sucks and its dying day by day by valves SJW system and the MMR system is copying league which is fucking TRASH.  Valve only cares about fucking CHINA. THE NA scene IS D3AD. Twitch DOta IS DEAD, only PRO tourneys then Dota personalities like in league.  More NA play Cs GO, OW and League then fucking this trash of a game. Most are fucking Peru dOGS. expensive shitty ITEMS and a Trash Reddit system where valve only cares about is reddit and high mmr players.

LMAO TNC. Mineski withdrew for this..\n\n5-man pinoy fans where?\n\nLook at all those triggered TNC fangays LUL downvote away pls!
1437 died for this 
What now TNC fangays? ?
322^10
Time for Kimo to qualify to a Lan. 
I'm talking about TNC.
this was a tactical pass to TNC by Mineski but Execration had other plans
TNC LUL 
&gt;"DOTA_Tooltip_modifier_crystal_maiden_frostbite_Description"\t\t\t\t"Rooted. Cannot blink, move or attack. Taking over time."\n\nTaking **damage** over time. Missed a word there, Buny.
And the guy before him? Because he wasnt.
what exactly was the combo? epicenter burrowstrike and rightclicks??
No way. Fnatic has a much higher chance from the start to win qualifier. TNC is just TNCrap.
TNC beat Mineski and VP and almost won a major and then they decide to kick 1437.... so that they can lose to a Tier 8 Pinoy team, and fail any tournament.\n\nGGWP TNC you guys sure are geniuses when it comes to roster changes.
But you're not "pwning" anyone if you're cheating\n\n\n\n
casters are jerax fangays
Because they want a 5-man pinoy pride for their team that's why. 
Almost won a *minor*.
TNC LMAO, so thats why raven is practicing his DP before the game they had a golden opportunity this time but they out draft themselves lol. WP execration
what major?
A bit exaggerated, but still. What tournament or qualifier has Xctn won lately? They are pretty low-tier by any standard.
Exactly. Tiny is like less valuable than the Witch Doctor at that point in the game. All he can do is hit buildings and use toss.\n\nIf they lasso Puck or Medusa I'm sure they win the game there.
Minor sorry. But still. It was a pretty big tournament.
Well medu was way back and Puck immediately phased after Sam's blink. Sam may have panicked and just lassoed Tiny and not the nearest hero, which was WD.
Isn't this lineup like one or two weeks old?
I think that would be great and it won't be a conflict for their 2 qualified Majors (DAC and PGL Bucharest)
TNC with Demon got top 8 at TI6 and TNC with 1437 got top 9-12 at TI7. I don't buy it if you wanna claim they're not comfortable with speaking English when they've done it successfully for two years. You pinoys are just not realizing your own weaknesses which is leadership and are very stubborn to accept it. 
get out
That's even more reason not to get rid of 1437. They really need him to learn better English.\n\nHow the heck they gonna succeed once they retire from Dota when they can't speak English? No Job will ever hire them. Better to keep 1437 and just improve on their English.
reflected elder titans aura made sk and tb destroy them, did you even see the fight recap? 
Epicenter Madness is EU servers only. So unless they wanna pay for holiday in Europe to play the qualifiers, I don't think it's possible.
dreamshit with their dumb schedule. now this exctn gonna play 3 series in a row, they should've done 4 series day one, and 2 series day 2 or extend it to 3 days
Perhaps.
Probably
expected the capitalist adblock romance picture instead KappaPride
Unlikely. EU server from SEA is around 300 ping if not more. You can barely connect.\n\nIf it was NA West or China server they could do it. But not EU.
Really annoying actually
Possibly
I do care, hang yourself
I'll edit the post once im back home.
Yeah... the rhythm is completely shit in this half-assed crap.
Preferably 
Yes, and? He had manta, but he used mom and then used manta so he silenced himself. He fucked up.
It's not particularily awful jokes aside, like he's nothing special, and he's a shit person, but he's not anyworse than someone like RawDota, the difference is simply RawDota isn't a scumbag.\n\nThis is of course ignoring the entire Bulldog thing which was simply really weird and out of the blue.\n\nThat being said I'd much rather watch RawDota than Teatime because fuck TeaTime.
It's reality. I'm not trying to make a political statement. It's a neutral statement that reflects current day world.\n\nIf you don't speak one of the 3 main languages of the world - English, Chinese, Spanish - you basically will never get a job outside of your own local place.
If mineski is invited and there are two spots for SEA in TI, Execration will most likely snag the second one.
Ignore that hater, ironically he sucks mineski's dick then change his flair when they lost. Cannot argue with stupid people because they dragged you down to their level and beat your with their experience.
Top200. pfff  \nI tell you a secret (in fact it's obvious for every 6k+ player) - most (about 70%) of 6000+ (currently) "players" - account buyers. Do you remember Vietnam 10000 solo mmr? One from his team is my friend. Bots are making 6k+ accounts for ~4 years. That's why you open RTZ twitch and see the same shit plays (like 2/3/4/5k) from other ~7 players. They all accbuyers ^_^.
You can still go 2 days.\n\nDay 1: the initial 2 series then the LB series.\n\nDay 2: The WB finals then the LB finals then the GF.\n\nFnatic has a series rest.\n\nEDIT: right people are shit at getting meaning. I meant you can still get a two day qual. [like this](https://imgur.com/iUEK3r0)

I failed :(
literally never asked for commends and I have over 1000 in just over half of your matches, so....
GF tomorrow can’t be achieve because EU DreamLeague qualifiers is tomorrow onwards. The players know the schedule beforehand. And if they want to rest, they should play well and get that winner bracket. And after EU qualifiers, it’s straight ESL Katowice. And after that it’s straight GESC Indonesia and then DreamLeague. So as you can see schedule is fucking packed and players need to rush to catch flight too.
do better, you shit.
first of all calm your tits fuckface. dreamshit can still schedule 2 days qualifiers with 4 series day 1 (2 first round, upper bracket final, lowers bracket series). second day lower bracket final then grand final. all other TOs had great and fair qualifiers except this shit 
you really are dumb
Seems like a which hunt, guy is 100% a toolbag, but honestly getting 40 friends to vote for you on facebook isnt voter manipulation. It's called having friends. 
Fuck Slacks.
All this shows is how bad facebook is for gaming atm, where 40 or so friends is enough to win a 'contest'.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with friends voting for you.
who cares? seriously
they're playing against a tier 2 team... and dominated?
It's not mostly tier 2 teams though, they direct invited Secret and Liquid while giving other regions 1 spot each.  Funny I don't see massively upvoted reddit threads complaining when it's 3/8 EU teams at a QP event(Just like last Dreamleague Major).
:)
i only caught the first 10 minutes of that game, wow i'm shocked they won
Wait for the actual tournament to start. I am not taking anything from lets just see.
&gt; i think ee might be one of the best players on this patch right now he understands the game very well\n\nLMAO
Copy Paste from my other comment on the original thread:\n\nWasn't the spectre vs monkey king? If you think about it haunting in on him with a qb when you know hes hiding in trees is a pretty smart pick.\n\nDidn't watch the whole game though but don't think I've seen that before. Seems to have at least worked vs boom id. My guess it was picked to catch tinker in the tnc series since it was picked after tinker.\n\nE.: https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/350190-fnatic/matches?hero=spectre only 3 picks in total in the last 25 days and they won 2 of those games. So maybe don't randomly just flame for 66% winrate.\n\n\nTo add to that I checked the bristleback as well\nhttps://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/350190-fnatic/matches?hero=bristleback\n\nThey played it once with universe and lost they played it a bunch more after envy had joined with a abysmal win rate (6 games 50% winrate) but OP used 2 really stupid heroes as example of envy draft.\n\nJust your usual Envy hate.
I never doubted EE-SAMA
UNIVERSAL PogChamp OHAIYO SoBayed
He doesn't know what chemistry is and after all this time never will, he's lost me as a fan because he just fucks up everything he touches.
Sees flair, sees username. \n\nOh. 
He is not most hated. How you can hate such a glorious clown LUL
&gt; against TNC or Mineski
was waiting for this post ,good shit 
This is my kind of content lmao
I think the org's plan is to kick EE not too long before TI quals. *Kick EE, win TI* is as good a strategy as any.\n\nEdit: to clarify, I like EE. I just have been meming this since they got him regardless of his results.
I mean he didn't have much success as a captain in the west. There is no question he is thriving in SEA and perhaps it's because they embrace his playstyle/thought process better than western teams did. We all know different regions have different metas and thoughts on the game, maybe SEA was where he needed to be to find the right fit as a captain.
Get off his micro-penis, they are playing shit teams. 
 Tbh, after all hate through Envy, I started to think that it is not really him that made him hated, it's just people in this sub loves to hate someone. Hopefully Fnatic can make some LANs and get QP so these floods of flame will stop.
really?
[WutFace](https://gyazo.com/5868ca1922b71be0699a13ea9c956f51)
useless af xD
This doesn't take away from the fact that their behavior with Ohaiyo was in bad faith. They are a slimy org, and EE is still slimy af. 
lul
What happened to Ulrich?
Why the fuck are you complaining about something so completely unimportant? \n\nAlso now I know you're probably a European and I'm ashamed that I share a continent with you.
Aegis have a heart but dota devs still don't\n\n\nF for pudge arcana and battlepass
no.. we lol now.
I don't get your point. it's an 8 team tournament. Who would you rather have invited than Secret and liquid?
Volvo plz gif battlepass
but this is ESL, we are supposed to hate them. 
where's my pudge arcana gaben
good patch
Hey now I'm married and despite my mother's insisting me last year (when we were engaged) that I should get my then-fiance flowers or something I reminded her of what *she* decided that Valentine's is stupid. So I'm married and my wife just went off to work and I'm gonna play some Dotes since I don't have to do anything today. 4Head
are u a retard
\\&gt; Lunar new year is approaching\n\n\\&gt; Has update to commemorate valentine's day\n\nI'm guessing this is just a prank'd, to prepare us for what they have for us in store for the ACTUAL bimonthly update
well that's still on the lower side and some in these 10% probably downvoted exactly for that reason. Artwork, patch, "my gf cooked this" threads are all 95%+ generally. 
Why does Valve got to flame us in game?
Thank you BSL, and hope to see you at Katowice! 
This, i fucking hate valentine's day. Fuck off, all couples should fucking die. 
Just continuing to fuck up on social media\n\nhttps://twitter.com/theflyingdj/status/963854808993103873
I believe people can change but only for the worse.
imo it's the 2 days that are unreasonable but im not attending so idc, good on em for adding more games though and before I get berated yes I know why there are 2 days and I'm not mad or anything just think id feel unsatisfied going for only two days.
if someone sells you a shitty product, they really don't deserve to be revered for bending over backwards to give you an average product
fuck off. you still suck hard and a fucking meaningless 3rd place match wont change shit.
guys we got a wild incel here
Bsl stop bug flashing on nuke vs begrip, it's not a good look man
of course it will be on facebook. they think adding a meaningless 3rd place match will sway the opinion of the kids.
Dont you have to go to school?
Eternal Envy is so satisfying to watch. Honestly.
Its 15 feb. already. Nice job slowalvo
Moron.
if someone knowingly sells you a defective product, then when you complain simply give you what you expected in the first place, do they deserve accolades or did they simply do what was expected of them?\n\nsure, esl can have as many games as they 'want' on stage, but certainly there was an expectation that there would be more (there are more at almost every lan i've ever watched). they didn't go above and beyond here. \n\nif they don't fuck up schedules for the next events, then sure they should be forgiven
Wtf is an incel you stupid nerd? I don't talk your internet teen slang. 
idk why epicenter doesn't host this qualifier stream themselves to up the quality of the stream, the caster is really good but 720p 30fps is not fine
you forgot the " :) " smiley in there.
Did they fixed that heavy lag in some big spells like mk ult?  I dont wanna play if that sh*tis not fixed....
Tbh, I like the previous version more.
Yeah watching right now and Im really surprised. This guy is good. Got everything. Knows what he's talking about, very articulate, and he's very clear in fights. Good caster! 
before this change it was an objectively inferior lan product in comparison to most premier lans, yes
They missed the most disgusting strat of all time tho. Wisp tethers to visage bird with attack tether ally talent and can kill t3 towers/raxes WITH backdoor on with an orb of negative armor. 
no
He's okay
people who dont know " :) " are genuinly replying kappa
nice
I'm not sure points will do anything - being able to overcome the mental stigma of having lost your chance to win the tournament is the problem. Hence why more prize money has never done anything in the past. Would be good if it worked though
twitch chat love people sucking of rtz i gues..  ":)"
Except getting points makes it worth a damn. Any team who has scored points previously would automatically be in the top 8.\n\nThe top 8 invited to the international.\n\nSo teams will take it very seriously.
Justice4EE
eh, I really don't care about a match deciding who's gonna be third. interesting for the teams because of the points, but...
it is objectively inferior, anyone who wants to watch less games can arrive late/leave early.\n\ni didn't say what you've put in quotes
No, we get ":)"...\n \nThis praise is genuine. He did great as a solo caster/observer. He didn't miss more hero kills than the current veteran casters generally do when they also have to observe while solo casting. Sure most of his analysis was simple play by play, but he kept up with the action and item builds. He got me hyped at the right times. All in all, considering this guy is a new caster (and isn't a pro player) I couldn't reasonably ask for more. Hopefully he casts more big games and gets some more experience under his belt, but he's off to a great start.
trash
He sounds so excited! Very fun listen
Which will get fucked by having an even worse spine.
&gt; EG\n\nEg is still not top tier?u fucking punks are never satisfied are you?Hope you enjoy being bitter cause I definitely love being the greatest\n\n
Its okay, but to me the major stumbling block is fans only getting to see 5 different teams play, out of the 16 that made it to the 'LAN'. This extra game doesnt increase the number of teams you get to see.
Competent Business Decision and Positive PR Move?! In MY ESL?!\n\n\nWhat alternative universe are we in? Did their management finally hired ceo's 7 years old son to raise caompany's competence?\n\n\n\nNow imagine if esl could do these things out of their own initiative,  not as a result of harsh criticism or threatening competition.\n\n\n\n\nStill not seeing esl becoming industry leader they dream of being any time soon, but I will take and appreciate this response, good job esl, may we not need extreme backlash next time and may your employees obtain kindergarden level of social skills and competence.
FeelsBadMan :gun:
Most casters don't do the camera work lol, they have Obs who do it like pimp or a co-caster
I'm glad that you are trying to add some matches on stage for the fans, but I don't know if 3rd place match is the best option. From what I remember in esports organizers are trying to avoid those matches because both teams know its "only" third place and they don't care too much. Often it ends with some kind of clown fiesta. Maybe it will be more serious, maybe teams will treat it as something they can entertain the fans and we will have good time though.
remember 3 miss kill streak at early game 2
Every time he said VIH-SAJH instead of viz-ij, i became very very angry. Other than that..not bad casting.
what happened to fnatic was they are gonna beat their way to win ti 8 beating liquid secret vp newbee eg og mineski with ee sama as carry and captain. i am not delusional weeb btw Krappa
He is the new Toby kenoby, calling it. You go Optic. Cheezy :)
Totally agree, congratulations KillerPigeon! At first I thought he was Tober! Quality stuff! 
Yeah he did a good job. He also did put me to sleep but I think that's because I was tired.
Come on, let's be real. Envy is a jerk, an autistic one. Many of his action in the past and presence deserve criticism. The big problem is, his in-game performance is not good enough to cover his shady stuff, most of the time, he is the weakest core, make questionable calls. Every once in a while, he has a good game, but that's it. Tell me, what doesn't make sense about someone so full of drama and lack any legitimate success being hated?
Only "extremely shitty" thing ESL has done was DMCAing Bulldog and others. Literally nothing else they've done recently in Dota scene is "shitty" in any way, shape or form.
I liked his whole cast tbh. Very well done.
Dude get a life who cares about cosmetic issues, are u gay or what??
I get this is a joke but every time I watch them play I like to imagine that all 4 players do nothing but try to keep EE alive while he runs around doing stupid shit and they have him muted the entire time. Next time you're watching them play, keep that in mind and you'll see what I mean 
&gt;**Valentines Day**   \nRoshan has custom attack particles for Valentines. | Preview  \nAegis now has a custom design in the shape of a heart. | Preview  \nThe inventory icon of Aegis updated to be the shape of a heart to match the Valentines Aegis design. | Preview    \n   \nBecause that's what the community wanted?\n
OG is called OG its not a abbreviation, so you cant call OG anything else meanwhile you can refer Optic Gaming to other names to clarify which specific team you mean\n\nI.e calling optic gaming as OG is just slacking on the caster's part
*pixels
He didn’t even notice haha
they need to stop spilling wrong facts though
actually they aren't  units of measurement\nthey are objects that are used to quantify
They have been nicknamed OG since long before Og was ever an org. They were there first. ITs literally only relevant if the teams play each other
Not in the dota sphere, get lost
Pixels are units, silly
Hitler facecam lol
Thats pretty cool that ESL listened to the community. Thanks ESL
Thats pretty cool that ESL listened to the community. Thanks ESL
Wisp tethered Weaver who time lapsed the almost dead NS i think.
Yeah he's pretty good - nothing irritated me, and that's actually saying a lot.
What a childish response.\n\nOne of the most renown organization in all E-Sports, always called OG.\n\n"I don't care, it's that way or no other way." Nice mentality. \n
Yeah, where do you think he gets his cheese? It's dick cheese!
Dude if its not the same dimension how can it be a unit? its a unit if every unit  is identical. pixels are essentially a group of dots (4) i think. Doesn't say how big they are. \n\nWould you measure an area in sq feet if they are all different sizes ? Cuz then based on who is measuring 25sft may be the same as 250sft
&gt; playing against TI winner\n\n&gt; gg trash team\n\nguess what Luna, you're good at pushing buttons but you're still human-shaped pile of junk
Jesus Christ that caster is blind. 
Thanks ESL, much appreciated.
NA right now is currently the most stacked than its ever been in the history of NA Dota. 
he yells too much, hype moments are diluted because everything from a 5v5 teamfight to a solo support pickoff are the exact same.\n\nhe doesnt have any dota knowledge
I was watching as well, and I was immediately struck by how promising he was. Quite knowledgeable and had a good screen presence. The only thing I'd say was not feel so pressured to fill all the air time with speech, as it can get a little overwhelming. Otherwise, he was better than a lot of casters that get higher to events, and certainly better than most casters BTS hires
1 dagger and I'm eating my socks
is that balanced?
this interface is so ugly...\n\nvalve is really bad at designing UIs
What?  I don't think I implied they were\n\n
wait is this some kind of joke or something? he is the guy who missed lot of kills with his camerawork and to be honest his casting was not really good. I am surprised that TrentPax stepped in and put in a good word for him. Maybe I missed something? sounded like Tobi but the comparison ends there I guess.
What do they measure?\n
Wrong.  Anyone who keeps saying as well deserves to quit casting
Hmm. Seems like no one knows how to read. I said they were used to measure. So don't tell that back to me.  They are not UNITS. Here's the wiki link to the SI units. Go find the unit pixel.\n \nhttps://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwzs7QhKfZAhUNzWMKHY6OBHAQFjABegQIERAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ycezOiUvkQ3wsSariVEPm\n
Thanks for the info bro. That confirms my statement\n
HotPokket
I mean compared to past NA regions the 2017-18 NA region is definitely stacked
EE should be kicked instead of Ohaiyo
What? When did I say they were a unit of distance? Do you think I'm so dumb as to assume distance is the only thing with units? Tell me what it measures then
I think purge was there too
Please stop saying visage weird :(
We can read fine, you're just dumb. A unit of measurement is a unit that people use to measure, and people use pixels to measure. They dont have to fit into a system like SI or imperial. 
Not necessarily bad tho, it could be playful. 
dont listen to this moralist bro, sometimes you just have to use hardcore/semi-hardcore references for the true fans
hey TrantPax Im your big fan, can you say hi to KillerPigeon for me?
&gt; holding a shield\n\nIt is not any shield, it is the Aegis from greek mythology.
I saw that part when I googled it.  I only said it wasn't a unit because it isn't recognized by the SI or imperial systems
So your saying his not "stronk" against tier 1?
All I see is TTours.
I think the joke about Moo's sex partners was pretty bad. Just seemed to come out of nowhere and even if Moo himself doesn't care it just seemed incredibly strange. 
&gt; "Seen"\n\nYou've got a pair of wonderful ears, buddy. 
Supporting casters and supporting people as a nurse in real life. SeemsGood
a unit is an unspecified measurement. when you talk in units, you can literally replace unit with any form of measurement you want. if youre talking about building buildings, units could be feet or meters. if youre talking about distance, 4 units could be 4 miles. in these terms, 100 units could be 100 pixels. educate yourself
hate to break it to you guys but XctN is not a strong team so im not sure what all this fuss is about
EG isn't the clear #1 out of the region anymore and everyone loses their shit. Just more even competition the region and fun to watch but disappointing when we get to the LANs. 
Until they try to get away with another shitty thing.  Which they will do, because they are ESL.
no one is really going to be fooled, after seeing this post I did this for a laugh with my mates, took me 3 minutes
Yes he sounds similar to Tobi with similar accent. \n\nHe also pronounces Aegis as "eggus" which is like Tobi's trademark at this point.
Yes and unit could also be a shirt or a phone or a house. Good point sir thank you for your amazing input\n
There were three I mentioned. Educate yourself\n
casting tips from you? ha
Don't act in bad faith, let Ohaiyo know, a few days in advance. Your question is stupid - saying honestly, are you going to debate whether they would win or not ? They made their bed when they decided to recruit Universe and kick Ohaiyo, they needed to live with their decision at whatever cost.
earth shaker es kotl wisp. HUGE pool
It's similar to British Premier League where any team can bet any team and easily lose to any team. Some season it's super hard to clearly see who's gonna win the league and yet english tean is struggling in UCL. 
OK, let's compare the pros and cons of what they vs what they should have done according to you:\n\n**What they actually did:**\n\n*Cons* - Ohaiyo feels really happy at qualifying and then sad at getting kicked/not attending. Note that lots of other players have qualified to majors and been kicked before attending it (TNC.1437, EG.Universe for recent examples). \n\nThe only difference between those players and Ohaiyo is that Ohaiyo was informed immediately after qualifying (because they were in the middle of qualifier season - blame valve for this).\n\n*Pros -* Ohaiyo gets a share of the money, 5 people get to play a major they otherwise might not have been able to.\n\n**Informing Ohaiyo before playing the major qualifiers:**\n\n*Cons-* Ohaiyo will most likely not play to his best ability (most people can't in this situation). This likely costs them the tournament qualification and Ohaiyo a share of the prize money. Moreoever, Ohaiyo is STILL sad that he got kicked. This seems worse from everyone's point of view compared to what actually happened.\n\n*Pros-* I am having a hard time thinking of anything... Ohaiyo does not get to be happy for a few hours before knowing he is kicked??\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWhat happened was definitely better for everyone except Ohaiyo. And even for Ohaiyo, the only difference seems to be that he would not go from super high emotions to pretty low emotions - he would just experience the sadness from getting kicked instead of the happiness of qualifying. To me, this does not seem better in any way.\n\nNote that they played with universe as soon as they were able to. If they were real shitbags like you suggest, they would have kept Ohaiyo on for the qualifiers the next day too before kicking him.\n\n**I would like it if you contained your response to my specific points instead of going off on a tangent.**
Its not special to cm but unvulnerable units doesnt benefit from auras.\nLike storm loses arcane aura when using ulti.
Hey art door can you see me? 
Dude I see that you're up to heroes starting with C and you still haven't spotted an issue of the following nature:\n\nUsually when you mouse over a skill and hold down alt it shows the skill's damage after magic amp.\n\nFor example if death prophet has 20% magic amp, mousing over crypt swarm will show that it deals 360 at lvl 4.\n\nThe problem is that certain values that aren't affected by magic amp also change when you hold down alt. For example, if you're a really intelligent silencer with 50% magic amp, holding down alt will show that your glaives do 120% of your int.\n\nHas this bug occurred for any of the heroes thus far?
this is a horrible analogy lmao.\n\n&gt; yet english tean is struggling in UCL\n\nother than the english which i'm not correcting, both basel and porto just got destroyed recently and even the arguably worst PL side in the CL is holding their own against juventus.\n\nMeanwhile in dota, any other team other than EG (or maybe even EG themselves when they're playing horribly) will get absolutely crushed by the top 12 teams in the world. I really don't see how it is similar. 
Let's deconstruct everything you said about your pros and why I feel you are a Fnatic shill and just an A-grade sociopath :\n\n&gt;Pros - Ohaiyo gets a share of the money, 5 people get to play a major they otherwise might not have been able to.\n ?? What ? Ohaiyo is getting his share of the money, I don't understand how it's a pro, its his right. I don't understand how you can spin that as a 'pro'.\nWho cares about the 5 people who get to play or not, you are a sociopath, look at what they did and how they did it to Ohaiyo, look at how the events occurred. I don't even understand your reasoning here, what they did was almost inhuman, here I'll SPELL IT OUT TO YOU :\n\n1. They won quals with Ohaiyo\n\n2. They made him think he's going to the major when they ALL knew he wasn't ( yes scumbag EE, Universe piece of shit, Eric Khor the backstabber and hyped-up (lul Tier 1 team after Ti6 lul) Adam) \n\n3. They ORGANIZED a PARTY and in his moment of euphoria, kicked him in the nuts.\n\nYou are a sociopath, almost as bad Fnatic for not understanding what he's gone through. You are listing pros and cons like there's no tomorrow when you can't understand what's happened. People like you honestly need stuff like this to happen to you, then you go around making your pro and con list. \n\nComing back to TNC, yes they kicked 1437 but not the way Fnatic did, they infact persevered with him after they won those qualifiers but it wasn't working out and it was quite apparent, what happened was shitty but it wasn't a kick in the balls like it was for Ohaiyo and yes 1437 is also getting his money. \n\nI honestly hope Fnatic crash and burn these TI qualifiers and in all the tournaments from now on, this is bad karma and it'll bite them in the butt one way or the other.\n
This is most broken talent I have ever seen and I am suprised it isnt abused more, free instant aghs for any of 4 people you have. You can get io underlord and melt base in 5 seconds etc. 
i know the average play meme but this is a definition of average play.
He's still 2 so... 
Professional casting. Hehe
one is a european caster(focus on meme spewing and trying too hard to be funny), the other one is a divine+ player(actually talks about the game)
The hero still has below 50 percent winrate in all skillbrackets
WTf are you trying to show?\n\nTeam A arrow Team B \nTeam B arow Team A \n\nWtf?
Caster did great work here, he showed what matters.. I was able to see kill on mid + PL tp out instead of camera + caster overhyping normal stun on MK because that's how you do this, that's how you stun MK.
just because they beat each other, doesnt mean that the region is competitive. it only means they are all on the same level, but compared to other regions they are still far behind.
Being on the same level is not competitive? What? Yes and I know they're not on the same level as other regions except for EG and coL which is why its NA Dota.
The caster is good but his observing was shit tier
It was average play, normal tree cut - the way you stun MK. 
Eh, like I said it felt too lax myself. I prefer keeping it professional.
It was about the reaction time and about the kill, dont minimize this just because you are a fanboy of the caster and/or hate rtz. 
Once you read the comment it is rather obvious what these abbreviations are supposed to mean.
maybe competitive for the NA region but not on LAN´s against the top12 teams. col qualified for so many LAN´s yet they fell out of groups almost every LAN. 
Can arteezy finally go to OG? Damn. This sumail offlane shaneaninags are hurting him. Sumail isnt offlaner, he is not playing like one. And he is not even mid, since he plays too much risky. Maybe yes, he has great laning stage (speaking of mid) when its 1v1. But it never is. So he is basically holding the team back. Just let sumail go. Or let arteezy go, he deserves better (pr just let uni come back and dump sumail). Maaan, I am so sad as Arteezy fan.
C9 with Sing and Bone7 as a player was never NA. The only organizers that thought they were was in the worst qualifier in the history of Dota, [the DAC '15 NA quals](http://liquipedia.net/dota2/Dota_2_Asia_Championships/2015/North_America). I'm a bit biased since that effectively screwed my SNA boys out of a spot at that event, but it was essentially just a device to get C9 to a LAN.
Now I know who the sociopath is. Not caring about the career of 5 people for the sake of feeling of 1 person. Thats sociopathic.\n\nThe drama has gone past its expiration date, EE went on podcast and cleared things out, Ohaiyo never talk about it anymore and is playing for LFY so looks like everyone got their piece of cake out of this situation.\n\nListen here monkey, you and all the other monkeys in this sub who jumps at any chance to criticize pro players should know that you are just a bunch of tribalistic animals who pitchfork people for your own superiority complex. You dont care about Ohaiyo or anyone lets be real, just the good feeling of being superior to someone who status you could never hope to achieve.
i don't expect anything from this company
Playing against retarded enemies, SO HARD TO BE DONE.
" ..killed *OFF* " plz guys, it's not so hard :(
40 ms talent is on level 20, euls drums is 5k gold. You wanna tell me he's this unstoppable machine in the first 10 minutes?\n\nAnd by mobility people generally mean things like blink, ball lightning or burrowstrike. Not a level 20 movement talent and third or fourth item. WAOW LOOK HOW MOBILE LION IS ^^^after ^^^he ^^^buys ^^^blink..
Why should carries be the only heroes who have the option of carrying the game? While if support heroes are made too strong, they can steamroll games and that is not ideal either, I don't like how past 40 minutes Dota heroes are fit into like two categories: **ones who carry the game** / **useless pieces of trash that are there only as as meatshields, disables, buffs or something.** \n\nUnfortunately I never played Earth Spirit nor Wyvern in their primes, so I can't comment on them, but in general I kinda get your point. If disables and damage both are too strong on one hero, it could be imbalanced. \n\nStill, the thing is, while disables are of course strong, I don't like how they are the only way for support heroes to stay relevant in the game. Because of IceFrog's "balance" support heroes are so gimped they are nothing but walking disables or buffs past 30 or 40 minutes and I don't think that's right either.\n\nThe talent systems are kinda changing this, I only wish more supports get scaling options thanks to the talents further down the line.
It is sad to see what used to be the most competitive qualifiers now becoming this. 
True. I have no faith in The Frog anymore, but let's hope for the best!
So if they've find a good strat it's called disgusting\n\nAlright
I see it
OPFrog FREE GAME NO BITCHING OPFrog
supports shouldnt and never have specialized in "powerful" spells. most of them specialize in control, DPS, healing or whatever. nukers like Lina Qop and Pugna for example specialize in magic dmg.
Couldnt agree more with this commend.
so you agree that having both insane disables and damge would be too strong, but don't thing it's right, whoch would mean that what is right would be them having both insane disables and damage
because the game isnt dead yet, but its dying. and we (ppl making threads about this or writing in those threads) rly care about this game and want to continue playing it for years. but if the playercount keeps declining we cant.
I make sick plays everytime i play with retards at 2-3k. It is not because i'm good, it is because they are morons, who can't play this game properly.
It's going down barely, it then goes back up. Stop bitching. 
The fuck? 99.99% of players including pros dies there how is that normal play? 
Oh my, I’m sure that screaming on top of your lungs DAED GAEM every day is gonna change things around right?\n\nAccept the fact that you have literally 0 power. Your words in this regard (and this goes for ALLof us) is worth about nothing. \n\nYou can say all you want, but Gaben chan won’t care. \nWanna know why? Because the precious charts you guys publish EVERY SINGLE DAY are made by steam, and steam is made by Valve, and oh boy Valve has Dota. You think they don’t read the same charts they make?\nThey know the player base has decreased. They don’t need ANY OF US to remind them that. Even more, they don’t need our crappy suggestions about role based matchmaking or something like which, according to many, would solve the problem; and for that I’m goddamn happy because it would ruin the game. \nWe have about 700.000 daily players and you’re worried the game is fucking dead? Call of duty, call of freaking duty, rarely hits these numbers after a month from its release.\n\nWhat’s your problem then? You’re afraid of LoL players who’re gonna bully us because we have less players? You seriously care about it?\nWho the fuck does? \nJust play the goddamn game, it’s Valve’s current main interest, you seriously believe they’re just gonna toss it in the trash can? You think they’re gonna (KEK) prioritize ARTIFACT OVER DOTA?\n\nBitches please, give me back my fanarts and fails of the week. 
Oo    \nwhat charts have you been looking at? the playerbase has been declining for almost 2 years. and its not "going down barely and then go back up", its declining. yes there are some months where it goes up a little. but there are more months where it goes down. and it goes down by more than it goes up. in these 2 years we went from 700k avg players to 450k avg players. as i said already: this doesnt mean that dota is dead, but its a rly bad sign and id rather not wait untill there are only 200k avg players left until something is done. why do you have to wait until the game actually is almost dead to accept that there is a problem?
haHAA
Thats not what I asked.
a blast to watch? Abaddons? Underlords? Omniknights? Razors? Tidehunters?\n\nMore like ResidentSleeping
Sucks to be you. 
* valve not giving a shit about custom games (server issues)    \n* valve not fixing bugs that arent directly impacting gameplay (time remaining on mm ban not showing - in the game for over 6 months)    \n* valve not having talent trees in the hero info on their website (this is a problem for new players who dont know that they should go to luquidpedia for accurate info)    \n* valve not doing enough to get new players into the game (lasthit trainer is a nice start, but not nearly enough)    \n* valve having shit communication    \n    \nall of these thing annoy ppl. and when ppl are annoyed by something, they typically dont stick with that if there are other options. and in the world of gaming there are always other options.
blink dagger, eul's, and pike.  
Nothing special about this. I do it every time I play KoTL.

Whats the problem here?
Caster on point.
you aware you just compared a no item lion with fully slotted carries, right?\n\nlion can't kill a 2500hp sven unless he has something like a refresher eblade, but an agi carry (with mkb mjollnir daedalus butterfly) and 5 seconds CC from lion can, clearly lion is too boring\n\nI mean, what?
Yes
This made me smile. :) And sorry to disappoint you.
Maybe
Ebyam
If everyone who thought the game isn't fun anymore stopped playing, it would really be dead soon. I'm not saying whining about it everyday is going to make a difference but I think it's healthy for people to keep the suggestions coming. It's undeniable that the game has a lot of problems , especially for the newer players and if we are to keep this game going we do need fresh players. 
&gt;Do you think I'm so dumb\n\nyes, literally everyone in this thread does, because you are
Who is this "we"? Because I sure as hell don't.
sadly cant delete it, my shitty brother still plays.....
probably most newfags here dont know why is he so important to the dota community
Yea, even the viewer counts are less than SEA qualifiers games nowadays. 
I usually see the game become very hard for shadow fiends once they get killed once or twice. Sure you have razes to flash farm, but you underestimate how much it hurts when you have to fight right away after respawning.
I'm sure GH can beat your ass with any hero.  
Maybe they should fix their shit ass behaviour score system (aka remove it) and let their game thrive in the toxicity that is REAL LIFE.
Sure but you don't fight in the early game if they keep ganking you, you go jungling and/or split pushing and come back with 2 items after 5 minutes. Other heroes actually have that way worse because not many have his ability to flash farm. Excluding the soul collecting of course, that sucks, but then again we are still talking about early game where he clears everything with razes mostly.
you are saying exactly what he is saying, but disagreeing with what he is saying.
The point is that valve could be doing a lot more for the game's growth, but they aren't. There's no excuse for the official website to be in it's current state.\n\nI wouldn't say it's dying but it could be much more lively.\n\nAlthough the recent feature that shows patch notes in-game is really great.
this graphic captures na dota so well.\nits shitty!\n\n
/r/murderedbywords
nah
It's the NA Circle of Suck 
Take my energy w33haa!
Notail u suuuuck ... W33 stopping OG like it's a pub gg
OG WITHOUT ILLUSIONS LUL
You forgot how OG relies on split push illusion heroes?
10% of the playerbase would be around 45k ppl. that aint enough for shit. if there are only 45k ppl playing this game, do you tink we will have a ti with 26 mio prizepool? or have ti at all? no we wont. because there is no money to be made. at least not enough. meaning if it falls to that point, its not just that you might have to wait longer to find a game. the entire comp scene will move on. is that what you want? no more competetive dota? no more dendi? 
sorry to brake this to you but there is no chicks with dick just man with tits. and thats what we called a trap.
i get that its annoying that there are a lot of threads about game becoming dead. but. just a "uninstall" is not an answer to problems that people name in those threads
small things like this get you actually high mmr, if you are stuck at 5k 
Yah!
And the counter circle jerk begins
I made the same post with memes and everyone downvoted me, i deleted the thread, next time i will just make it simple.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bbfh0gz.jpg
Didnt meepo used to get his first two ult points earlier, but his third ult point later (3, 10, 17 – compared to the old 6, 11, 16)?\n\nFollowing that logic he should get his 3rd ult point on 19.
Valve fucked up TF2 do hard it's been dead for years.
I thought this is a pokemongo post, I was wrong……
read "Bulldog’s picks of shame" as "pics of shame" and got excited for nudes for a sec
OG only lost 1 tower score is 43-16 but only 17k lead ?? the kill on new patch seems so meaningless.
Maybe it's a feature to nerf dirty meepo pickers (puke) makes them tilted in the late game. 
They had around 25k last tournament.
Is the million dollar tournament the reason you play Dota?
I stopped playing (actively) and I still love the game. My reasons are - I moved to a different country about a year ago. I only have my crappy laptop now (not taking my PC on a plane) and a wifi. The lag is horrible and I go to 10-20 FPS constantly. I still watch streams, check out reddit and read patch notes. Occasionally I play game or two a week, TURBO was a godsend for me. Sometimes I play against bots but they are really different experience (and not an enjoyable one).
Fly as a pos 5 is so underrated. People rate the lad's ability to captain but he is definitely one of the best 5s to boot
You should join a pro team!
Alliance flair telling someone from a team that has qualified for 4 Majors to "Join a good team".  Nice joke.
u are a sad person.
[I'm just going to leave this here] (http://steamcharts.com/app/570#1y)\n
Reddit is trying to make people think the community is friendlier with the new patch, but these fags are at their worse.(^^examples$
What time is it? It's killing time.
Because everything gets boring after a while, and it is very hard to get into something as complex as Dota2, especially when u have LoL , Smite and HOTS. They're way easier to just pick up and play.
u fukn dare m8 or u jus flexn
Don't speak the Norwegian tongue but I understand this phrase
ty i will\nnot plaing daed gaem no moar
xD
Yes because shitty pub players can play like pros right ;DD Who cares if MM is a constant fight for mid xdd le dota is a flexible gaem but people still play 2 supports 1 off 1 mid 1 carry 99% of the time xdd
Er... Okay? What does that have to do with the next patch? 
W33ha was actually the most useless person on for all 3 games. Just a 0 pos support, imo.

You think.
Say, is your programming knowledge "just started a course"? Do you have any reference as to what the average programmer gets paid and how much you're defining as "actual programming knowledge".\n\nI'd love to know more about how not only are you demanded, but your referenced credential is merely "actual programming knowledge", and that as long as you're not a wordpress designer or a script kiddie you're safe.
Correct, which is what I said.
Because he is claiming competence yet affirming wildly innaccurate statements, I don't buy his bull, he's either an impostor, misrepresenting his success or simply unable to relate to someone who started a course in programming now. So yes, I'm not going to treat someone who I think is being dishonest as well as I would someone actually backing up his contrarianism with more than "I don't know but I think" and "I can't keep the recruiters at bay".\n\nBeing condescending to someone attacking your view through deception looks to me just fine.

It depends who gets the last hit:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7xtcdh/stacking_camps_with_warden_main_hero_and_taking/duazpuw/\n\nYour main hero must not get the last hit for you to get the bounty gold.
&gt;you're safe as long as you know actual programming\n\n&gt;as long as you breathe programming you are probably fine\n\n\nCompare these two statements and realize the distance between the two. In one you imply cursory knowledge of programming, qualified as actual programming knowledge and not "script kidding" and "wordpress designing" makes you safe. In the other, you claim "as long as you breathe programming you are probably fine", which is evidently a gigantic leap in position.\n\nSo yes, now I agree with you, just realize how dumb you were with your first statement.
Already been reported here
TA traps don't actually aggro creeps, so you can't stack with them.
Keyword here is "feel". The changes will be there wven if you play casually 1 per night or less. The jump in skill is just a very gradual alope instead. Sources - crusader 0 to legend 1 since patch came out playing no more than 2 games a night
He should tell this to Puppey, Kuro and Fly. I don't really agree with him, I've been a filthy casual (I watch more dota than what I play) for almost 3 years and I'm still climbing, slowly, but still.
I guess but anecdotally my own experiences and those posting about maintaining divine ranks. It is possible

I only played 2 party games this week and I feel like I dont know even how to hold the mouse properly anymore 
As a 12k ledditor you should go install LoL.
I mean tell that to necro :P
Joke's on you, my favourite class is the Huntsman.
I think that's *extremely* common in dota. Specially older dota players\n\nIf I can't play at least 3 games a day I don't even bother starting dota\n\n
please bitch I stack every camp 3-12 times if I have a sven or some shit
Okay first up, there's 2 mid heroes and an offlaner there. 
Same cancer as always, just cant go invis anymore.
He's also had a biomed degree. To pursue further medicinal fields, he'd need the right license and stuff, but he's got the prereq to go into master's at least, to remove the rust with some research work.\n\nEven if he does choose to be a programmer, he might be one hell of a good one. I'm not in the field myself, so I'm not going to say much about his choice to go into IT, but I respect his choice.
Is the joke, you're so dumb you needed to take your pc to a repair shop? good one m8
I've been playing unranked most of my dota 2 career.\n\nAnd don't regret it for a second. What merlini says is true but if you have  been throigh the binge wc3 doto era, even 5 games per week will suffice and keep u decently going
Why do you think he's going to only take one course before looking for a job?
programming? starting a course? he completely switched from his old field before casting wow
Nerf to a strong meta hero. Seems good. Kappa.
It's a weird feeling that I have with Dota that I never had with CS or SC2 and in both games I had partial success reaching DMG and Diamond. I feel like if I don't play this game on a regular basis I neglect something I shouldn't.\n\nI've invested 4000 hours into this game at this point and am sitting at 4.5k MMR right now. So sitting at that rank I can safely say that I am "good enough to know that I am shit" while still being better than a relatively big part of the playerbase.\n\nI do take breaks from Dota. Usually for weeks before I come back to play it religiously, because something in the back of my head is telling me "you don't want your skill to degrade". I don't know if this has something to do with the sunk cost fallacy or because I'm proud of how well I understand the game, but it's a weird feeling I just can't shake whatsoever.
why do you need exact timings? You need to develop a feeling for this, depending on which direction you pull, and if you can make the creeps stay outside of the spawnbox at.00
na just talents
Plus, you can just play Turbo if you really, truly, want to play casually. It represents like 40% of the unranked games played or something, so queue times aren't too long.
I am a cat person, but this is cute. 
You guys remember Kaolin?
I noticed her but who the F is RUSH?
I have quintuple stacked every camp in the game, including the small camp when I have an alch and/or i'm on a hero that can stack 3-5 camps at once. Highest stacks at once in game is probably something like 12 on the radiant bot ancients (which are super broken in terms of stacking right now, you can get 7 stacks easily with any ranged hero, far more than the other anicents)
im fairly sure the bot hasnt been updated for a shit ton of changes but alright\n\nedit: also im pretty sure you promised 2 quit dota after you lost your 1v1 to me but here you are so thats cool. ccnc it
oh wait i got lightheaded idk why i thought that he was saying that he's nerfed a lot
All hail the fallen king 
I stopped playing on my 4k main and just started spamming smurfs. \n\nPart of it was to get around the insane que times at behavior score F but also I just don't want to spend 40min-1hour playing a game in soloque, just to get a higher number, only to have a bad experience at the end of it because solo que is just trash and a complete waste of time. Only reason to play solo que is to practice mechanics. Otherwise it's just a rage-inducing time waster.\n\nSo now I just spam smurfs - crush new players in low unranked 3k games, don't have any worries about getting reported because I 'stole their mid' or am 'toxic' for telling someone what they should be levelling to help the lane. \nI never chat, never type a thing anymore because I no longer care about the outcome of the game.  I used to feed down mid if some idiot stole my lane and fucked up our draft in ranked so I could have the game over and move on to the next. But now, I just smile and ruin their game by forcestaffing them into opponents and typing "?" when they die. \n\nThen when that account gets into lpq, I make another smurf. \n\n\n\n\n
Well done, but AdmiralBulldog did it before: https://youtu.be/6XZEsBQitUA?t=163 :)\n\nEdit: Sorry to all who didn't get the joke :(

i dislike players who are really bad at dota (such as rawdota for example) yet try to take lanes from people 2k mmr above them and then have the audacity to say shit like they are good. thats all
not really, coming from the guy who played 1000s of matches vs it.
you mean rylai? 
I found the weeb. /s
This hero and techies should be completly removed from the game. Their whole gameplay/abilities etc... doesnt belong to dota. They only reason theu still here is because of cosmetics ppl payed for.\n
The tango change is probably not the biggest one but still significant since it changes the entire laning phase economy. Add to that the sweeping changes to the economy with runes and stacks, and constantly fiddling with a core mechanic of the game: the courrier.\n\nIn two patches, supports went from business as usual to poor as fuck to rich as fuck. This is not keeping the game fresh, these are large changes to a role that affects the entire game. Adjusting to those changes takes time and by the time you do, another patch turns the role on its head! This is just exhausting and demoralizing when you have limited time for the game.
Just buy dust
yuge nerf
They do belong to dota, they just played diffirently from other heroes. Learn to adapt and stop being a crybaby.
Descriptions here still indicate that she turns invisible on webs.  \n\nAlso, I had an Agh's idea recently:\n\nTwo abilities to be gained as a pair:\n\nMother's Comfort: Broodmother calls all of her young in a 900 radius to her side, finding strength in numbers.\n\nAll units affected by Mother's Comfort become untargetable, invulnerable, phased, and uncontrollable, moving with Broodmother. They no longer have a despawn timer and do not attack. Broodmother gains +0.25 to strength, agility and intelligence for each affected unit. 2 minute cooldown.\n\nSkittering Onslaught: Broodmother releases her young to attack, returning up to 50 spiderlings from Mother's Comfort to their regular state. Affected units remain invulnerable for one second on cast. Cast automatically when Broodmother dies. Affected units return to Broodmother over the next thirty seconds, regaining their phased / invulnerable state and reapplying their attribute bonuses if they are still alive. 45 second cooldown.

Safe is definitely the wrong word. Unless he has talent for it, it's not a job that you just pick up and make a career of.
I can get 9 stacks for sure on those ancients with any ranged hero, I've done in on jungle enigma while jungling normally. Stacks 10-12 were done with an earthshaker assisting with fissure. \n\nContext on the game: we had a rightclicker ember, and the enemy team had near zero stack killing capabilities. I was stacking the shit out of the jungle so our ember could farm it when he got bfury. He cleared the whole camp in 1 extremely long slight of fist. \n

yeah, well, my dad works for nintendo.
He gained a lot of followers because he also speaks in Twitch Emotes. Like, every sentence ends in a Twitch Emote.
This guy is a shitter.
OMEGA FUCKING LUL
He has to occupy his time with something since it takes his team 3 months to qualify to a LAN.
You don't protect your system with a password? 
Yea man, he seemed absurdly arrogant after he played that 1v1 vs. S4 in a Puck mirror match. While he did play that one pretty well, he just misplayed one or two times too many. What’s the big deal, you lost against one of the most accomplished professional players, be happy you could hold your own and don’t diminish their skills by stating how you “almost beat him”.
You're right he is joking. One reason its a joke iss because a single downvote can't really do much to hide a post. Unless he make an army of downvotes or something..
Seriously.\n\n":-/ \n\nSorry Blitz.  I really used to be an asshole.  I still am sometimes, but I'm trying my best to work through that and stop it.  I really hope to make something of myself in this community, so I hope my improved behavior speaks for itself.  If you ever encounter me being a prick, don't hesitate to reach out and tell me to check myself.  I'm just here for the DOTA.\n\nMuch Respect,\n\n-that guy"\n\nThat took 30 seconds and no thought to whip up.  A real apology with no bullshit is not hard.  It's not even hard to fake a tiny bit of sincerity.  The fact that he couldn't even muster up that is pretty telling.  
yeah, but my dad works for nintendo.
What a fucking moron.
Beginners do not understood 90% of all terms in your post not talking about what is the synergie between enemy heroes.
I remember one silencer game, enemy team had enigma. I made that enigmas game hell by targeting GS only for his black hole. 5 interupted black holes later he got bkb but he ulted first and then bkbd so i had small window to ult and i pretty much ruind his game.
How do you actually play with an open AI ?
how can i play against it?
hahahahah you think you're arteezy dude?  \n"actually" stop typing like a retard

As a support player with 4 cores in archon pubs, I agree. I told them to rs then push mid after destroying t2 towers and they  refused because they need complete items eventhough we can end it already. They tell me who made me captain?

No. Pick phase and strategy time takes more than 2 minutes. Plus finding match
How do I get to play vs this shitty bot anyway?
I was insuating that he is not worthy and hasn't really done anything of note so shouldnt quilify. Or thick sure. 
tbh he did pick willow + this is nothing compared to when i queue euw with english language and then get 4 russians.. lolz good times
Flat like the Earth.
But now she looks triggered, maybe because she knows people will now only play her because she has better bobs.\n\nOr she might only be angry because she knows that some people might play her with mouse only thus her winrate going down.\n\nDota is realistic af.

Btw that how ppl play venge back in dota 1, me at least. Too much fun just swap ppl into tower

Dark Willow is still not top tier?u fucking punks are never satisfied are you?Hope you enjoy being bitter cause she definitely loves being the greatest
Cries in Erdoğan :/. Thing is they charge like 22$ a month for that, there is also a gb limit that if you exceed it your speed gets even slower until the end of that month. 
Make it 115 gold for stack of tango, and TP scroll for 135.\nWE need old  dota!
Mute all players and get Courier, Boots of Speed, Tango and Clarity EZ game.
The fuck is this schedule. Lower bracket team will play 2 BO3s before their final
And if he didnt?\n\nJust cos he won the game does not mean the hero should be picked cos someone wants to play for fun .\n\nIntention for ranked is to progress. Failing at the draft stage is not progression
Where can I get this bot script?
What now, haters?\n\nWhat now, Blitz fangays?
I donno about that. One thing to have a 1v1, using one of the most basic (mechanically speaking) heroes in the game and a full 5v5 game. I see it as the same concept as self driving cars. Cool idea that might be practical in 10+ years but the actual technology is no where close to being legit yet in the real world. Prob be a Dota 3 by the time a bot team could challenge a decently skilled team.

Interesting read. However I’d hardly say miracle was the gold standard in Dota today.\nMaybe if he keeps this level up for a few more years.
I don't remember anything special in the patch note, could be not there =/
this thread is I liek. mr. frog always a mysterious dev like a writer. man if frog didn't develop this game he might be still successful by writing this into novel/book. I'm just a fanboy of Icefrog. &lt;3
She is strong, not broken. Countered by many heroes/items/playstyles. \n\nI mean, she can get kills against certain heroes, sure, but some other supports can push and get towers as easily and nobody calls them broken.
Probably not because this isn't the real patch 7.09. it's actually part 2 of 7.08
I mean. CCNC is so lackluster. He never brings his A game.  feel like he is someone who just cracks under pressure
enjoy your boobjob and shat ap :&gt;
You're overestimating how much Valve cares about the game.\n\nWe went from detailed Valve made events, to custom game events, to [pictures of events.](https://twitter.com/wykrhm/status/964476202407702530)
why is nahaz so sweaty jeez
Because the only events people “liked” were the ones they could use to farm items. They made a new Diablo-style game last time and people didn’t like it. Since then, they have been working on the new incarnation of the battlepass. 
there are at least 30 heros that can destroy anyone with a 3k gold item if they catch someone alone
I'm sure you mean: speciesist. You baboon.
And yet none of them has a 2.2k damage spell on a 30 second cd\n\nEdit: or a 3520 damage spell on a 20 second cd 
you're either fucking retarded or intentionally missleading if you think that you'll ever deal anything close to that amount of damage. it's like claiming wd has a 10.000 damage ult

Oh so youre retarded, at least we resolved that issue
Excellent reply because you realize you were wrong. Will be saving this post, thanks for that 
You completely ignored the second part of my comment where i compare it to wd's ult (which is a fair comparison) but keep sticking to your narrative, youre obviously just bad
Damn I thought the clip just looped with Puck at full HP again. How he could calculate the pros and cons of buyback in split seconds is really impressive.
Must I really explain why they're nothing alike?\n\nOk.\n\nWD's ult is over the course of 8 seconds, can be interupted by a stun, hex, silence, banish and most important of all, is a channeled ability meaning you can outrange it easily.\n\nDW's bedlam is not a channel, does it's damage over the course of 4 seconds, doesn't stop when she's CCed.\n\nthey are nothing alike. If you sit there for 8 seconds and you eat every tick of a death ward then yes, it does more damage. The counter play to death ward is that you can cc WD or move away. Tell me, how do you counterplay Willow's bedlam? Stun her? How, she's untargetable and unless you're lion, nyx, ET, slardar, how are you preventing her from running you down with bedlam?\n\nSo please, don't sit there and pretend like your argument even has the smallest amount of logical thinking behind it because you clearly think that you've figured out DW and she's not broken but in reality you're in some shit crusader bracket who acts like a 10k redditor. \n\nKindly go fuck yourself.
Right, those SA teams have climbed their way up from not being able to qualify because they are terrible to getting a valve mandated spot in every tournament and last place reserved just for them!

Almond is a girl you oppressive white male!
because people here will see it and think that pangolier randomly spawned in the game 
so youre saying dota is p2w?
What?
What?
so YOU ARE SAYING that Almond can't be male if she wanted? so YOU ARE SAYING that just because Almond is "she" she cant choose for her self what gender she wants to be? so YOU ARE SAYING only males can choose their gender you oppressive oracle 
this is both cute and cool
Did you ask who assigned Almond's pronouns?  Maybe Almond specified that (s)he specifically wanted to be referred to as a she.
Gotta get that 300apm so can't fap?

There was a n earlier post about this, didnt she just let her lad play a game or something in the early rounds, and didnt she actually get disqualified cos she was on a six month work break or something from the uni so she wasn't actually a "college" player? \nHardly worthy of mentioning in an article alongside matchfixing etc, seems a bit witchhuntery to me.\nI think this article is really bad, i shudder to think what it would be like if something news worthy happened. ( if its the same story as before and i think it is).\nIf college esports is attempting to grasp at pro sport status this is not the way. This pomposity is imho ridiculous.\nI played football in the UK, twice in my time ( over about five years)we had to draft in a "Ringer"cos we were short two players at very short notice, this is ofc not in the rules, the club was fined both times as per the rules,  in both instances it was because we actually wanted to play rather than forfeit, we were still a player down, it is hardly worthy of a mention alongside match rigging  etc etc\nJust ridiculous high handed article, i can only assume their is some personal beef
You're not a true Dota player until you fap during pick phase. The thrill of deciding the perfect pick for team synergy while alt tabbing/multi tasking is a requisite for reaching 9K mmr.
you were saying taunts give you advantage. now youre backpedaling to joke.\n\nwhat a sad child\n
that reminds me i still got to do it for today cheers

Time for witchhunt!\n\noh wait shes a woman. they cant be hold responsible for their actions.
I don't get it. This is just the typical shitter getting exposed.\n\nStep 1: Shitter doesn't know any of the players, but complains about prior experiences with negative players in games.\n\nStep 2: Shitter does poorly in lane and complains. Criticism or support is offered, shitter reacts poorly, tries to feed.\n\nStep 3: Shitter complains about allied team in all chat, or spews vitriol at his own team. More than likely asks for one player or another to be reported. \n\nStep 4: Game Ends. Repeat step 1.\n\nLow behavior score is a huge red flag for me. I've never encountered a match with feeders unless I queue with friends. My score is in the mid to high 9k.
Probably because my initial statement was a joke as well, you dim wit.

So if you cheat in a video game you're not supposed to get an education? Wtf.
seriously come OOOOOOOOOOONN volvo sort your shit out
Thought this was old news since its Feb 17 here.Then i saw 8 minutes ago.
Telegram
Oh man! Sweet localizations! 
Zingle????
sorry just being cancerous, ignore plz
I came just for this!\n\n(Yes)
why did you decide to become flairless void? no favorite hero or team?
Why does razor sound retarded here?
Is it strange that I'm annoyed by the people who get annoyed while trying to explain something to the clueless?
It’s soccer 
Flair checks out
Blitx, however, is an attention whore. 
Nobody cares about this anyway.\nStop posting unnecessary drama. Its kinda lame.
Bot's owner testing Artifact confirmed.
Fuck pets tbh. I used to have one of these and it kept startling me by reappearing all of a sudden next to me and I would think it was a blinking hero or something.\nThen it made me waste a critical BKB charge one game and after that I hurriedly unequipped and sold it for ez $$$.\nIt also doesn't help when they're on the enemy heroes. So all in all, I'm sorry, but I hope no one at Valve thinks this is a good idea, really.\n\nIf only there was an option to disable pets from showing up for only yourself, I'd be down to it.
Even if it's just a backend change people still wanna know.
CHinese dota scene is dying

Thank you.
He probably made at least 10$ per hour scamming walmart! holy shit!!!11
you have issues with merlini being called perfect, you need to think of other casters that are better? To answer your question, fogged is on the same stream.
Thank you for your work. It really should not go underappreciated!\n\nHopefully those backend bug fixes go in line with those posts I've seen about those tiny visual bugs on each hero, like Crystal Maiden's  animations not playing with certain items, or Bristleback's weapon always clipping on the floor. No point in trying to figure it out, I guess... Only Valve knows.
Much appreciated!
Why is my steam telling me it has to download 3.3gigs of stuff if it's only 100mb though? wtf
I feel the need to masturbate everytime I have a way too good game or when I lose a game. Anyone else? 
‘definitely’ unbiased, because merlini has never raged or ruin games in his entire life.. lawls
Wth. Merlin is a con artist?
Wth. Merlin is a con artist?
Kek!
it's not like he's not being invited, he has been invited, but none of the organizer could meet his demand. I think he stated that on ESL and some other organizer this season. Even back in TI7, he didn't cast any game on the main stage. Whether that was Valve's decision to improve their panel or Merlini had issue with the salary of casting live games remains a mystery, but to me it was strange that he didn't get to cast any game on the main stage.
thats how he speaks usually.. raves on personalities now and then. definately hypes up anything/anyone he gets excited about. when he is not excited.. just shuts up and can be extremely dull!! lol. he calls everyone shit too.. as a joke i assume (and explains why if they are not on the stream..usually a close friend like conrad).. anyway he knows them well enough to bag them..just called fogged shit like 3 times on the stream. on the otherhand when he fanboys (as per video) he usually says something like..i respect _insert name_ so much b/c this one time when this happened _insert story_. that's just how he talks. mostly entertaining. worst case gives up some behind the scene industry stories which is always nice. 
No, viper’s character design was much better in wc3. He’s currently one of the worst looking heroes imo 
You sure do love [defending](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7xhhwb/script_user_skywrath/du8mywf/) cheating as a rule though. Something tells me you're just an incel.
EE downvoted this already
i have the same problem with lifestealer
It's nostalgia kid. You won't understand you probably never played DotA in W3
Nostalgia does not excuse bad taste, nor stupidity.\n\nDon't even bother trying to argue about nostalgia man, my first video game was pong, and i can tell you, i take any tennis game there is today over it.
&gt; kid.\n\nYea enjoy your rose tinted glasses "kid"
I meant people wanna know that's all the update was, otherwise they go "1.5mb patch???"
Yeah i know lol, but the severity of the "crime" and the conclusions drawn in the article ( ie likening it to match rigging) are the point i was trying to make i guess.
Yup i read it, and quite clearly she broke the rules, but also quite clearly to mention it in the same context as match rigging in a professional tournament is ludicrous and smacks of going over the top, thus ( to me anyway ) makes the article a bit trashy
Ah kk, so what was the other article about her being not actually at the college etc? Also do you think as the aggrieved party that letting your boyfriend on your account cos you lost game  1 is worthy of mentioning in the same light as match rigging in a professional tournament as the article does? Dont get me wrong, its wrong, its against the rules but it seems hyper ott to present it as it is presented in this article (to me anyway).\n
+1, I would even add that i prefer about a third of all old model over those of dota2.
While I agree with your sentiment here, this guy just hasn’t read the patch notes carefully enough, there are plenty of times when stacking is not good for the team and you could be doing something more impactful. If your carry can’t take the stack in a reasonable amount of time or the offlaner can easily steal it for example 
Sounds like excuses to me. So pray tell, what exactly does CM's pet do to your gameplay? Because I'm trying to think of how a little puppy negatively affects my game but I can't.\n\nEdit: I meant give me a 'for instance' since /u/hkrX9 seems to be struggling with it
sorry but this article is just a boring wall of text.... hard to read.\nAnd I don´t think it belongs here... Okay this Girl fucked up in a College Lan.... but the comparsions in the article are much over the top
you really need to learn when people are joking, no need to respond seriously to everything
Dotabuff or it didn’t happen
Why you gotta be such a dick? He's just saying he prefers the one on the left because of nostalgia. Why do you have to try and make him feel bad about his preference? Just because he doesn't like the one on the right, it means he has bad taste?\n\nYou claim your first video game was pong which means you must be of a certain age. Well you don't sound like it. Act your age why don't you? Cause you sound like the typical teenage brat.
Look how fucking stupid that new viper looks, old one is very low quality and is made of like 3 colours in total but it doesnt look like a shit show in action that is that living gay pride parade viper. Thats what most new sets are now, random shit with particle effects.
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking\n\n
and then everyone on your team said "report the carry, everyone else commend the support"\n\nand then they all applauded\n\nhis name ? Merlini Einstein
If you think something without a HP bar or a hitbox is a unit, then you got a bigger problem and it's not with the game.
Yes but in-game, the puppy is **waaay** smaller and it doesn't move like a courier(it moves around and stops erratically), let alone its absence of a hitbox and a life bar. I don't see how you could confuse that with a courier.
I understand that she's a shitty person and should absolutely punished, but it makes me uncomfortable that they posted her steam profile. 
&gt;Also he was wrong\n\nWell yeah I'm not saying he's right to insult the other guy but you can't use wrong arguments like that too, 2 wrongs don't make a right.\n\n&gt;"nostalgia" is not an argument for taste\n\nAnd also, you don't have to have an "argument for taste" since taste, by definition, is a person's preference and no one should have to validate their preference. He was simply stating his reason for favoring the picture on the left. It was not an argument and should not have been taken as such. So you can't argue against his reason for his preference. He could have said something like "Because I like stuff that are ugly" or "Because I think it looks nicer" and you *still* couldn't have said anything about that to him because *it is his preference* and preferences are subjective.\n\n&gt;People always use nostalgia as an excuse for saying stupid shit\n\nI don't know about this but in this case, he didn't use "nostalgia as an excuse for saying stupid shit" simply because it *is not* stupid shit because it is personal preference.
Merlini definitely HODLS cryptocurrency - bitcoin ethereum etc.
"Merlini is a perfect human being"\n\nUm... Ok.
&gt; I only commented on that, nothing else.\n\nYeah and in doing so, you also made it sound like he should feel stupid for liking what he does.\n\nHow would you feel if someone made you feel lousy for liking something you like? \n\nI'm not getting white knightly in the sense that I'm defending him, because I'm not defending him, I never was. What I'm talking about is your extremely idiotic mentality that someone who likes something you don't is stupid. Try to get that into your head because it seems like you're seriously struggling with that. But hey, you're not that dense so you should be fine with it right? ;)
Why on earth are you also stacking the camp your carry is heading at? Should he just stay and wait for your stacking to finish or take a sub optimal route because his support isn't able to read basic movement? \n\nI hate this update, kinda forgotten how shitty 'support' players are
Yes.
WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS
its not like any other race will date asian guys anyway
The carry was stacking himself. OP was in the way and got greedy for 15% instead of helping his carry
No the support was stacking to help his carry and the carry ruined the stack. Can you not read?
Nice blog.
&gt; This guy thinks he can get the bonus 15 percent gold if he stacks it and farms it at the same time\n\nDno if you're trolling but not gonna bother if you didn't even read op.\n\nTo /u/-tasogare- stop being greedy and focus on helping your carry
I just don't like people getting doxxed, kthx
Are they? In my matches the new instalock carry is Troll, but that may be because I'm playing with new players with my noob friend.
Doesn't matter. It's still just a hobby on the side. But even if they cheat on their job, what does that have to do with getting a university degree? Those are completely unrelated evens. Why should that uni have to consider the moral fabric of their students? That's retarded.
Involve? It's a university. They aren't employing them. They aren't getting any value out of them. They're providing a service to them. Do you think hair stylists should give their customers a survey on the trolley problem to find out whom to serve and whom not to? I just don't understand why that's at all pertinant to studying there.
EE downvote incoming
I appreciate your time but it's quite obvious that OP is saying he ruined the stack for the 15% extra and not the entire stack. Jesus
There are no "codes" for university attendance in my country. It's uni, not Hogwards. I could have literally murdered someone (outside of class) and wouldn't have lost my spot. Why would my professor give a shit what I do in my spare time?
I miss the old dota. It doesn’t feel the same any more :(
Pretty sure most NDAs are bullshit
I like the old one better.
typical chinese tbh
well merlini was talking about him as a sort of successor in the bts stream. And blitz was there too
Yes and if you didn't read till the end I understand why is can be confusing. Reading further makes it quite obvious that it's just broken English. Twice he mentions that the stack is indeed succesful. Anyways we've both wasted to much time on this and I don't know what else to add to make it comprehensive to you so believe whatever you want, this was such a time waste
Another proof that Blitz will use any opportunity to stay relevant
He makes all this shit up. It's not like anyone is gonna watch him for his casting or skill, so he constantly has to stir shit up and prey on others. \n\nTheres a post about Blitz daily for the last week. And it's not like the news is centered around him, he just has to give his opinion about everything. He's a leech that never amounted to anything. The only thing he is known for was getting fat and then losing weight, broadcasting it like an achievement. Probably 80% ppl that knows him will say that this is what he is known for the most.\nHe couldn't find a way in so he went for a pity
Kind of a good thing, would give a huge advantage to some heroes who can double/triple stack camps with their skills. Is it just KotL blast or have you tried others? (e.g. Wave of Terror, Caustic Finale, etc)
how bout we remove pets from Dota 2, because I mistake them for courier
if he was rich i dont think he would care about how much he gets paid to cast
No one with brains ever does that.
It's funny that i've played for the same amount of time and hate this game with all my soul
How would you know?

Don't you know that racism is only possible against black people?
Ah, my bad then, didn't realise backend changes don't come up as a patch.
is she at least hot? 
welcome to planet earth
It really isn't. \n\nIt's an above average game of a unique genre whose competitors are all a joke.
because having a piece that can move infinite spaces in a staight line is balanced, oh also you have 8 pieces that can transform into one of those by just moving them 5-6 times! yeah, that's balanced.
or they can treat neutrals as heroes, just what like they did to pudge and rubick to avoid cliffing. i think im stupid
Wow really ? You're an idiot if you've been playing the game for 10 years and now you realize that it's a good game
It feels like a really forced way to accomplish it.  At least out of anything else i have seen.
I rather scan entrance of rosh pit as it gives some information about hg near it.
Blitz was not invited to last TI. Yearlier TI's he posed as coach of random teams to get there for free. Last TI there was an empty spot because Bulldog did not get there. How about you get your facts straight. Yet another example of him using someones misfortune to his own gain     
To hell with georgia!
PJSalt I'm sure you have a better game that could crush DotA 2 . You're such a genius tbh on making that comment .

Doesn't sound too different from a girl and her boyfriend at the club and she dumps a drink on some other dude and shits on him.\n\nThen runs behind her boyfriend when shit gets real and the boyfriend just coddles her.\n\nAnd you want us to believe that not all girls are the same?
Oh yeah the lets pu this peace in bot sides and get acces to it as soon as turn 2.\nWhy not we also give each team in dota a free divine rapier at minute 5, we are giving a rapier to both teams so it's balanced! 
the whole paragraph hurts my brain 
Perhaps.
Who do you think she just dumped the drink on?\n\nGo out and meet some actual women, jesus christ.
Then somehow I only meet shit women the same way people consistently had Peruvians on their team before the 6 month ban implementation.\n\nThe probability of getting a team of english speakers is pretty damn low. So its not worth abandoning matches just to find that 1 team of people who can actually communicate.\n\nThe same is true for women in my experience. Its not worth it to try and find a unicorn under a mountain of turd. It is more efficient to try and focus on yourself and enjoy your own life. \n\nBe grateful for what you have and enjoy the small things in life. The people who love you and cherish your existence and genuinely want to spend time with you.\n\nAnd if the pattern in your life is that it is only dudes who treat you well and chicks treat you like shit, then why the fuck are you going to deny that?\n\nMaybe you have a different experience. That's cool, enjoy your life buddy. But based on my past experience, I've made up my mind.
How is that even an argument.  "Well i like the mona lisa more from a skill prospective, but the guy who took a dump on a canvas fulfilled his vision much more thoroughly and is much more unique..." Like being unique and conceptually interesting is fine but that doesn't make the visual aspect better.
Technically, jungle LC is still a thing, even without the iron talon. I've played a match in patch 7.07 where I was jungling with LC, got level 6, dueled safelane, then got back to jungle, went to gank whenever Duel was off cooldown. Did that for like 20 mind mark, then got out of jungle completely. We won that match. Jungle Midas legion is just a joke, I think.
Darn it /u/Darnit_Bot
Junglers play jungle because they cant even win a free lane
can we get some pics of this girl? I need to know how much I care. 
i won a game as wk jungle recently
ROFL
League of Legends . Waiting for salty comments and ready to grab my popcorn
Jungle = weak lanes = autoloose = reported guaranteed for the jungler
This is incorrect, the first time it will credit the stack to the person who cliffed the creep. The next times it will accredit the stack to the person who cleared the camp. (The creep on a cliff is untouched in this scenario.  \nThis is due to the "stack buff" counting who agro-ed or killed the creeps last as the stacker.  \nStill cool though, might make a video tomorrow.
That's my point.
BabyRage SOMEONE DOESNT THINK MY FAVORITE VIDEO GAME IS FLAWLESS BabyRage\n\nLiterally go to your nearest convenience store to buy a bloodstone and double click it.
IMHO the most bizarre one is TF2, they added an item to encourage rocket jumping and added passive 35% less damage taken from self to soldier, just because some dude liked to shoot at his feet to go high.
That's the sad truth. I've been waiting since 2013 for a moba to replace DotA. I've tried a lot of them since. All trash designed to bait kids/whales to p2w or just terrible gameplay.\n\nMoba is full of shovelware.
EZ play. Used scan so it wasn't 6th sense like A or M-god play. Huge aoe on spells too. This play was 1.5/10 max
eh, average prediction. Obvious reddit would shitpost, so it would be stupid to not comment in that exact thread and even fake not knowing what shitpost storm you were about to start to make us think he wasn't going to do it!, 5/10
What chu' say? white first?`cmonBruh
so, we get a shit 4k gold item to farm a stack, EEficient.
10 years? WutFace what are you 30? I played since 2014 and i consider myself a young " veteran " XD
I refuse to believe you have any experience with women at all. If you do - which I doubt - I have to assume that you go into every interaction with a woman with an incredibly hostile and combative mindset, super thin-skinned and brittle and ready to take offense, and immediately fuck everything up because you're so oversensitive.\n\n\nHonestly grow some fucking balls. Go read the top posts on /r/niceguys or something so that you get a sense of how people see you, at least. In the absence of conscience, perhaps shame will fix your character.
If AM is strong enough to kill 1 ancient camp, he's strong enough to kill stacked ancients. The more the easier it is actually.\n\nKilling stacked hard camps as SOON as you get battlefury can be tough without a stun or something from a support though.
problem is people pick useless laning heroes like luna , or spectre when they see a jungle in their team , instead of picking heroes like bloodseeker , huskar or ursa to win their lane a.lone\n\nu can still win with a jungle in ur team but people is too convinced that jungle is the worst thing ever that they play bad cuz of it

They’re much more popular than you will ever be you fuckinn dweeb
you can hear it clearly in the 3rd video, at 5:25
no offense to Merlini but stop sprouting bs. Warding has been forever and EE invented stacking in No tidehunter.
well, he had a point tho " greedy supp " :V
Rofl Dota is not balanced its just that every patch something else becomes broken and you forget about the last. 
Yapzor is still not top tier? u fucking punks are never satisfied are you? Hope you enjoy being bitter cause I definitely love being the greatest
You can actually get the 15% bonus gold if you stack and clear the camp yourself as a carry, you will notice once you kill the neutral it gives much higher gold than expected. Also once you stack your hero icon shows in the spawned neutral creep that came out when you stacked the camped soooooooooo you get dem 15% gold bonus. More reasons to be a self-dependent carry hehehez
If Dota is so bad, why have you been waiting for a better copy of Dota for 5 years? If you hate it, go play some other strategy game.
Because you're doing it wrong?\n\nKite them and pull them out. The more there are the more their pathfinding gets fucked up, and the least likely a purple satyr will fuck you.\n\nKeep downvoting when you're oblivious though. Stay bad.
Those both draw agro. Is there a part you didnt understand?
fuck trevor
Torrent would deal damage after they land, so after the camp is stacked; the stack as it is would probably not be credited to Kunkka.
You think that being a drag queen is the same as being a porn star? lol sometimes I forget how stupid gaming community’s can be
I believe the match making system is generally fair on skill level. Your salty words are about the girl in your game only reflects that you actually are the noob, the toxic and the flaming one. It it so miserable to play as a girl on Chinese servers because of people like you. 就你這德性， 沒人噴你親媽裸死浴缸已經不錯了
Well, that is getting fixed next week then. Thanks for making it public and reaching a front page.
Those are bigger impact changes, but not extremely complex mechanics.\n\nLook at all the mechanics in dota. Theres a lot of them, but most of them are extremely simple. Together they give depth. Look at other mechanics in the game.\n\nKill thing, get gold.  \nCamps respawn at minute intervals if empty.  \nKill tower, team gets gold.  \nKill ancient, win.  \n\nThen suddenly  \nEmpty a camp but keep enemies alive and the enemies that spawn in the camp next will randomly get a buff that is tied to the hero that emptied the camp. The creatures with this buff will give 15% of the gold to the hero the buff is tied to, but only as long as a member of their team other than themselves kills it.\n\nThat doesn't lead to depth. It railroads things, I believe. Its heavy handed in how it basically decides how the game should be played.
This means your team is losing 85% of gold each time the camp clears while you gain 15%?
source?
I clear big stacks as slark no prob... u only need to do it in night. go in the middle of creeps, dark pact and pounce away. get hp back, dark pact, attack, dark pact -&gt; dead. May use ulti for that so u don't die. \n\nmistake imo is making stacks when you can't protect that and enemy has some1 who can kill it in no time (like shadowfiend as presented in example above)
good player with shit attitude
I don't see how it's a problem for AM to clear 3/4stack of ancients with treads bfury. U usually still bring a support, cuz they want levels, so they can help you clearing it while protecting you from ganks.
useless if they have a descent off cuz the lane is gonnna be 1v2
sometimes is better having another core cuz the enemy team just wanna farm and play passive
Till 2013 I thought the same then I realized the game were and is changed because they sell it out.\n\nBefore this time Dota was like a mirror. How I felt in this way I played. It was amazing but thx to valve they make it to a cash cow not anymore to a great game. \n\nI look still esports matches but I have no fun to play it anymore. 
what about spells like lina's dragon salve? I swear I've stacked camps with that before 
the build is not bad though, if the player is good he can solo kill anyone.
Oldtimer HeyGuys :)\n\nP.S didn't dota come out in 2005?

MISERY IS NOT PLAYING  AS A POS5 HE WAS REALLY F* BAD. Sumail was the best  player continuously creating space for Fear and Arteezy IDK WHY people blaming sumail who only failed in game 5 vs dp  silencer and silencer was  not even showing  him in the map  what he do blackhole by keep sitting back looking for perfect BH so silencer will cancel it ? silencer  Played PERFECT THAT game FEAR wrong timing idk  sometime he is Playing godlike sometime shit.If his Team mates are blaming him he should leave the team. 
How in the fuck is this so upvoted. This is fucking disgusting. I wonder if you guys would've upvoted a guy who raped several people in the past, but 1 day while he was browsing the internet, he found out about Dota 2 and got interested, then he went on Reddit to make a shitty post how that cured his anger and blablabla. Fucking Christ, Reddit, you gotta be mad.
Oh it's fucking great, it's my main use for it. You can absolutely rek stupid Shadow Fiends with scan and dust, for instance, since they have no escape when they just farmed shadow blade. It's best use is scouting out smokes though, since wards do not detect those.
A game where over half the competitive games end in a draw is not balanced
It's funny because you are probably right and this is what actually happened but OP is a low mmr idiot and thinks that his luna didn't want him to stack at all.
I was playing with a WK earlier and he placed his icon on the jungle in strategy time. I told him its retarded to jungle these days and go offlane. Guess what... he did go offlane. I can't believe it. And we're in SEA.
It's *too* balanced which is also a thing
This is dumb tho. Like what if I draw agro of 2 creeps in the camp after somehow forced movement on the 3rd creep? Is this gonno count? It should be fixed imo. Your explanation is good tho, I probably wouldn't have realized that for a long time.
Game is good, Valve’s Shitty behaviour score matchmaker is not. Report system is far too easy abuse and there’s no countermeasure for rage reports
Are you Divine 6 player?
you can hear pudge ult as well. "FRESH MEAT"
It is when you're 13\n
&gt; Kill things but you have to make sure that you are the only person that deals the final killing blow to the unit which will award you 57 exp and between 38 and 44 gold, but if you don't get the last hit then you will only get the exp and get no gold, even if one of your own creeps does the kill despite them being on your team.\n\nLast hitting too complicated please stop railroading the game volvo
It's really not, though. The choice to stack camps or not is still yours, as much as ever. I think you're way overthinking a simple incentive bonus for supports here. Stacking camps takes time and focus, that could be spent on other things. And the 15% boost is so low that that in itself isn't going to affect the meta that much, if the crude calculations I've seen done hold.\n\nBut at the end of the day, stuff like this can only add depth to the game, as it introduces new factors to take under consideration. You think you have less to think about as they make things easier and more obvious for you, but the fact is everyone gets the same information and mechanics as you do, so it's all evened out in the ened in terms of competition, and you have to now focus more on other things instead. And there are plenty of things to focus on and remember in dota, on many, many levels. Try reading the whole encyclopedia of mechanics within the game, learn it by heart, then apply it wisely in-game. That task in monumental, and things like this only complicate it, not make it simpler as you seem to think.
Exactly. Stacking is important in dota, but at lower levels, players simply don't bother. Either because they don't understand the value, or would rather be doing other things. I'm fine with this change because it gives the supports a direct reason to do it. Sure 'your carry gets more farm and can help you win the game' is already a good reason, but let's be honest, people like getting things. Giving the supports a direct reward for stacking will encourage them to do it more. And it's not even a huge amount; a large camp averages 101 gold over the creeps, so that's only 15 bonus gold per stack.\n\nThe more interesting thing in my eyes will be seeing if the pro meta shifts as a result of this. It's a buff to heroes who eat stacks like Alch and AM, so will be cool to see if they get picked more.
Fuck off with old normie shit memes please.
I don't usually ruin games (like a 1 in a 1000 games thing) but honestly something like this is very tilting.\nIf the rest of the team are acting like entitled bitches I'd be walking down mid in this case
and has a 1 second delay. kka with brown boots has 340 ms which allows him to move 1840 units away (not counting torrent aoe)\n\nedit: actually 1.6, even worse\n\nedit 2: downvoted for pointing out a potential bug of a newly implemented mechanic. the cognitive degeneration here makes me wonder whether darwin was right.
What do people even mean when they say DotA is balanced?\n\nIf it were balanced picks and drafts wouldn't be so decisive. I seriously don't get what they mean when they say that. Is this about the two teams and their geographical distribution and placement on the map? Because I'm pretty sure the two sides of the map aren't symmetrical either, and that must count for some counter-balancing things at least in some way, some of the time, but that's a little too deep to speculate on at this point in our general knowledge of how the game works.\n\nSo what do people mean? I'm confused.\n\nEDIT: I agree it's the most complex game I know, and probably in existence, period, in terms of how many levels and kinds of skill it can take to win it, and of how wonderfully infinite in its possibilities it is, play wise.
who said 5 cores lmao 2k ?
Unless u have someone to tank the creeps, threads +bf are not sufficient to clear those 3/4 ancinet stacks. Even if you does clear it, your hp will be way too low for you to even safely continue farming other camp / push lane.
Idk if radiance proc cold snap. 
Edit: nvm, zenotha is right i forgot only fully powered traps deal damage
115%&gt;100%\n\npeople fail to realize the biggest upside of this is creating gold out of nowhere, you can have a higher team networth by stacking, this is a 15% that otherwise wouldnt exist. If you stack them and take them you are denying your team of 15% gold, so every time you take a camp you stacked you should calculate the opportunity cost of that 15% vs being someone else who gets the main bounty
Did you watch the clip? Do you think Merlini is living the nyc lifestyle?
something tells me this legend and bellow.
People are insane. I'm Legend 5 almost ancient and I played a game where i got matched up with a party of two on my team. A ancient 2 and his archon 3 friend. The archon 3 flamed me the entire game. Most of the time for reasons I was unsure what he was even talking about. The archon player went 0-13 and I was like 6-6. Some people are honestly so stupid its mind blowing.
Consider it like this, you pushed 1 creep out of the camp with blinding light and force staffs and aggroed the remaining creeps with right click. I mean there are ways to force a neutral creep away from the camp so far that even if you attack other creeps, the one u forced away might not get aggro. Then what? 
I imagine jungle players look like monkeys irl
his point was to stack other camps, mine was that letting your sven clear the stack increases your team's gold, even tho you dont get most of it, so if you are a 1v9 selfish player you will farm it, but if you are a team player you will calculate the opportunity cost of losing the 15% vs getting the extra 15% but you dont get the 100%
&gt;Every time I picked a jungler\n\ncan u gtfo of ranked games?\n\nIt's not viable, you cripple your lanes, you don't need items to have an impact.
nope, that's best in most scenarios, sure, all im saying is to use your brain.\n\n The link you provided was carry gets IT or TA gets it as an absolute, what im saying is to analyze the situation and decide which one is worth it more. i hope you understand that while TA is a snowballing hero and will benefit most of the time from taking it, sometimes you will have a hero combination that makes it worth to not get it
It can be adapted through experience. I don't say it should be like this, but at least it's fair and not game breaking. Imo earth sprit's remnants being visible in fog is much more grave in compare with the roshan scenerio, since es is a gang/initiation based hero and seeing the remnant behind the trees generally gives u a bit more reaction time. \n\nI know I can't make everything right, so I advocate for what I think is the most important, which is at this point reporting system, because it forces people to play and behave in certain way and punishes creativity and fun aspect of dota. Doing something unconventional and failing generally means low priority nowadays. And I know a lot of people stopped playing dota from time to time due to this reason, including myself. But then, its another day's discussion.
Just when Gaben wants to help you win, yet you complain. Shame\n\n\njk, Gaben please fix it T_T
Sure, and I know this change isn't the end of the world. But its still a step in the wrong direction.
There was a point in time when Phase + Madness were the first 2 core items on Exo Invoker. If you are wondering why, it was because Exo Invoker used to gank early and ganking with Phase + Madness + Cold snap + Alacrity took almost no time to kill someone.

Guy is a fucking diva 
No, we're not. There is a big difference between playing dota whilst not giving a fuck just because you "want" something and playing coscientiously and selflessly without wanting to ruin the game for 4 other people. I want to play safelane, but too bad, sometimes I don't get to and so I support.\n\nYour attitude is the cancer of this community. "Deal with griefers". Great, very constructive.
Yet you have the same MMR. Either playing jungle isn't an autolose like you want to believe or the junglers you find deserve a higher MMR.\n\nGet off your high horse, you're entitled to nothing when joining a match of Dota and what you think is the best way to win a match of Dota isn't necessarily true for every scenario, despite Reddit being an echo chamber of your opinions.
FUCK the card game. The fact that it is taking resources away from dota so they can make a half assed hearthstone copycat makes me mad.
huh? I didn't say anything about other card games
Wait one of these 4 teams is going to a minor ? \n\nGG\n\n
One question, are you retarded?
nope
I was honestly expecting T-Pain
well optic lost 0-3 against iceberg in the finals of the GESC qualifier,thats  on them,but why no optic or col here?
TBH, latest changes to sideshops are garbage, now you can't make phase boots there, can't make battle fury, can't make oblivion staves, can't make MoM, can't buy bottle.\n\nIn a couple more patches you will only be able to make power treads and arcane boots, then OSfrog will just delete the sideshop altogether.\n\nFor a game where everyone abuses the fucking courier to fetch a single clarity min 15 on an offlane omniknight, removing useful pos1 items is outright retarded, and creates an artificial gap for people trying to carry out of the dumpster tier nedlessly. What was removing phaseboots suposed to accomplish?
One retarded?
By the logic DoTA 2 is a half-assed League when the devs left TF2 to work on it... far from the truth. Valve has never disappointed me
Eg is a direct invite
It's time to invite them to events again. Somewhat stupid to have them play qualifiers.
The EU scene is so bad apart from the top 3 teams.
What about no? lol. They do nothing against tier 1 teams, and direct invites slots are limited mostly at 2 per region. Sure, let's not invite Secret or Liquid so we can have OG there.
winning one lan and placing top4 at 3 lans is the definition of performing well at lans but whatever
how do you know rest of the teams arent really good? They get constantly beaten by OG that placed top4 at almost all tournaments they went to.  \nand Kinguin placed 1st in the group stage at that Chinese Lan not so long ago
What if i told you they have finished top4 in every LAN they have attended with their full roster since winning Macau?
It already have a pro team ready to play while the game is not yet close to release, how can you consider it's another copycat? 
this is literally the best meme of the month
Yes,immortals have fallen on a cliff after that 1 event at the start,hence my reaction.
this subreddit might be the king of unfunny garbage\n\n
&gt; as the guy who had his fries stolen by siractosalcks\n\nfucking who?
og got 1 minor win and 2 minor top3's in their last 4 minors/majors they attended and eg did get 1 top 3 in the last 5 tournaments or so and og beat/outplaced them at these last tournaments. They did a lot more then eg.
navi isnt there? wut. i thought they would be somewhere up there  \nfaceless/fnatic/teammalaysia is boosted with many worthless wins  \nobligatory: Natural 9 LUL
Unless you're EG. 
He just Really good 
There's an argument to be made that 2nd place at TI6 is more impressive than 1st place at TI3. Dota's gotten way more competitive since then. 
How is this funny or amusing? Not getting it, in fact it's kind of annoying. 
something about watching aui lose gives me a hard on
Yes, OG is well known for tilting. 
¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯
Spelling is intentional btw
made by who?\n\nWhat's even the problem that changing the shop items is triying to fix? If you want to nerf safelane item timings at least find a way to affect them across all skill levels, and not only on shitty pubs, you know, like increasing the cost of battle fury instead of forcing 2 minute courier trips (that now don't have Speed Burst) or risking entering the enemy secret shop.
maybe he randomed meepo for the first time and found out that he is the god of microing, so he started to spam it, dont be mad because he got good
actually og beat eg at summit and outplaced eg at cd in groups and the tournament in generell but that wouldnt work for you, right? Its fine og will outplace eg the next 4-5 tournaments too and maybe then get the invite.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That's cause you annoying kids were being little shits, so they took your fries. Fuck the 'woo' and overly large sign morons.\n\nI left halfway through the quarters and didn't feel bad cause I figured at least I didn't have to listen to the woos for a couple hours.
i personaly love playing againts boosters, its just a game guys and im pretty sure everyone here has over 1000 games [ i have 8000 games ]\n\nthis is practice to me, back in the day, in our net caffe, we used to play fifa 13 on Superstar difficulty to get better and over time one of us would score a goal or win a game \n\nplaying againts players that are WAAAy better than u is the best training u'll ever get
Ok I won't. Your definition of retarded is someone who criticizes a card game? I think you might need to look up what that word means.
When did I say all card games are hearthstone copycats? This one is.
I don't have a list of how many people are involved, but there are plenty of people from the dota scene moving towards this game. Whether that is due to them losing interest in dota vs being pulled in by the game, I guess I'm not sure.\n\nBut I think you'd be full of shit to say it is taking nothing away from dota.
That’s pretty much their only recent achievement so you gotta give them that.\n\nOg fans have been pretty starving xd
not really surprising, OG playing their max. can easily compete with Liquid, Secret and Newbee. But nice to see them shaping up finally.
[Yeah, okay.](https://www.opendota.com/players/174664689/matches?hero_id=82)
how does anyone get themselves to play 39 games of meepo in a row?
boring NA teams ... yawnnnn
BSJ was the problem
hadahaohahahahaha
This is a problem with this party invite lists. The fact that a terrible can have such a streak and guaranteed spot after a lot of playing is dumb. It holds the scene back. But because Secret and Liquid are technically EU they never get more slots. I believe that secret and liquid are no longer EU teams as they never play in that scene. \n\nAlso third party tournaments are inviting based on pro circuit points. While I agree some teams should be invited I do not think it should be the teams that just have the most points already as that would cause less new blood in the scene. Don't know of anyone understood my poorly articulated argument. 
Why terrible, is hands down the best late game hero. As well can be an amazing split pusher, and annoyance through out the whole game. People in low skill have no structured way or knowledge in how to handle him. 
And that's how you get input lag. 
was it really? I don't remember that
Why not a big "does not work" over the pit
That's not how valve works.  They have like 20 devs that work on whatever they want
Free gaem
So... you want to remove the drafting stage?
So you are saying Pain Gaming deserves a spot in Epicenter XL over say EG, TNC or a Chinese tier 2 team?\n\nI can't disagree more about giving a spot to teams just because maybe one day a team will deserve it.  Look at the South American scene in CS:GO.  Only one team from SA was ever really worth anything in SK, and they were good so an NA org picked them up or an Org in general, they worked hard and earned their place.\n\nWHen the scene doesn't even have any good teams, you dont throw them spots just because there might be a good team one day in SA.\n
Low MMR players put the scan almost entirely over the rosh pit, detect players outside the pit and assume it works in the pit too. You should be putting the scan only partially covering the rosh pit so scan area covered outside it is increased.
Dota 12 PogChamp
lol OD definitely wanted to get the fuck out of there when Fogged was analyzing the game 
:)
He has some serious mental issues...
Chappie is showcasing the dirty side of dota, being an immature kid with some anger issues or something. I'm glad he will always be a tier 3 player that will only be talked about for his toxic attitude.
if you want to go looking for the links you can do it yourself. it has been discussed on this sub plenty.
I think it did count because he gave first blood? someone correct me if Im wrong.
people at that high mmr leave a game and just queue next .no time for shits like this.most of them dnt even report i think.just mute and go on
y dont they make it so u cant scan the pit
Truly one of the worst people in the scene, can he just go away. Some serious mental issues at display with this kid
clap
Totally unrelated fact. Chappie already known for his toxic behavior before those visa issue. That guy just actually has mental issues.
Oh it still doesn't count if it's not the first blood
just ban this fucking toxic
Crap my brain.
PERMABAN inc monkaS
LACIST cmonBruh
new idea..let valve ban people manually as long as the proof is submitted to leddit kappa
Is this a favorite meme right now? Why is this shit upvoted in every thread?
Can we not bring these retard twitch emotes into reddit thanks
No bitching
"Delete your lies and apologize" is one of the cringiest videos I've ever seen.  
He didn't rly ruin a game because the game didn't count at all since the game didn't even start. He just ruined his behaviour score, nothing else. And took away about 5 minutes of life from 9 other people who don't rly care cuz they play dota anyways.
Expect the despawn to be removed next patch. XD
bot games dont count into streak nor WR (it does count on the W-L in stats though).
the problem could be more fundamental, such as work visa issues, i would think china is very strict on work visa and immigration of their own citizens, in this case i doubt there is any resemblance of e-sports work visa.  if there is none, i can't imagine how a chinese player could just get up tell his immigration officers that he wants to play dota in europe.  the hoops are imo more government than dota.
pepehands
I mean, wouldn't you rather play 4v5 then have them feed all game?
Yeah I'm starting to think there is a reason he didn't get a visa, like he didn't do the proper paperwork in time. 
I mean no stats recorded so.. no harm other than a longer q.
Nothing new here, ACE has always had a deathgrip on Chinese scene. Players can try to unionize but... is that even a thing in China?
this is a new copy pasta
chinese doto team is just a rich boy game, after all
Learning basic English is way easier than learning Dota
What an asshole. No team should ever pick him up
he deserves money with playing dota, so playing dota is his profesion, so it counts. 
money laundry comes to mind, but I'm sorry for the players.
The "communists" don't allow workers to organize ;)

what the fuck did you just say dude?
Boo fucking hoo, i can sit on my ass and play game all day for six or seven figures income but this particular setting is annoying, i am as miserable as a child in africa who can't find food, water or shelter.
/u/xandois is not really saying anything of substance. He has no data for how many people are banned, how many aren't banned but should be and what conditions must be met for a ban.\n\nIn other words, he has not only failed to prove that professionals are exempted, but also that regular players definitely get banned at this point. 
TBF any person can last pick brood and win. 
I have never been able to understand that aspect of professional sports, like a player can just be told: so you like sunny california? too bad, you have been traded to vancouver - and then a week later: so, you like warm and comfy vancouver? too bad, youre going to calgary. they just bought your 15 year contract.

this needs to be emphasized more
I seriously hope this comment is ironic because if it's not I want to die slightly more than I already do.
yeah, so ridiculous. A talent player may rot in a trash team if the owner does not want to sell him or the price offered is not high enough. 
I wonder if this will get front page with 1k upvotes
ROTK doesn't understand how this works. ACE exists to protect the interests of the owners. If he wanted to change it he would have had to establish his own org, convince players to leave en mass, and then setup their own union and make demands. Chinese owners would be forced to re-hire them or at worst, find players outside china while the new union finds new investors where there are many who are eager to jump in and create their own tournaments. 
Inb4 this get 1k downvotes\nJebaited
that's why its called a 'MINOR' so that T2 teams get a chance, also one of these teams has a TI winner and 2-time Major winner.\n\nBTW flair checks out :)
HL3 confirmed ^^^Krappa ^^^^^PepeHands
Who is Jack? Jacky Mao aka EE?
Reddit? SoBayed
flair checks out? what does that even mean lmao ?\n\n
Lol SumaiL adds banner back after realizing no one fell for his childish bullshit
Very simple. Because that is CHINA. Be prepared to get ~~flame~~ cyberbullied by the whole china's dota community for being a traitor. Don't forget china is more or less considered a communist country.\n\n卖国贼 will appear in all the player's social media account. You know when EE lose to china team they say EE has a chinese heart? Well if EE was actually top tier and his team constantly cock block china team those same 3 words will likely appear too, and EE is just chinese, not a china citizen.
Koreans aren't as godly in dota2 as they are in sc2 or LoL \n\nand there are countries that produced better players than korea\ni.e. sweden, denmark and fucking china this country has half the TI Wins and you consider korea as the god mode country? LMAO
shut the fuck up just because the game managed to not count it wasn't an attempt at ruining a game? you're the kind of guy who would say "yeah he had a gun and yeah he shot at the guy but he missed so it's not that bad. nothing else"\n\nhe'll just ruin the next game
I used to play lots of Zeus 4, i go mid and usually arc the shit out of enemy mid by using it properly so 90% of the time it doesn't arc on creeps to push lane, you accidentally get 1 cs your mid SF starts just raging and pinging me, even though enemy mid can't even get 1 creep and i fucked all his regen. People are so retarded.
its easier to help your teammates to power spike by giving them assist while keeping your enemies from spiking and controlled rather than outfarming everyone while your teammates struggles in lane\n\ni've once lost with my AM because i was the only farmed one in the team ...  so the best choices are invo meepo or tink.. brood is good but it might struggle in 3K+ since most guys there actually buy detection
Gtfo with all that rational sensible talk! This is Reddit! There is no place for that here. 
maybe but im lazy to check but lets say hes play pro dota for 2 years then about 2k$ per month so not small either 
i only check money hes earned but i though milions $ only come from TI winner ?
if chappie lived in the US hed shoot up a school
why xaxas always tosic?
I don't think Fear is bad at all, I actually blame it mostly on Sumail. He is really not confortable on that offlane.\n\nI believe this roster/roles won't last much longer.
damn U must have no idea how dota works... ancient player i bet XD
VP = toxic, you are the same.
LPL is the largest esports competition in the world. And it is going to be franchised and localized. Leaving the LPL doesn't make sense from a monetary standpoint.
Can you show me some information about the gameplay of the new card game?
Really ? When I play sf mid, I buy my own mid wards. several over the course of the mid game. Even sentries if I know opposing mid has a ward. If I get a good rune, I even gank the lanes. If I die to a gank ... am angry at myself because I prolly should have paid more attention to minimap. \n\n\nPeople who play sf like the post are probably the most retarded type of players ... not just sf players in general :/
&gt;could be cool as like a Moonduck event or something.\n\nSo like a minor?
Reddit? SoBayed
Not all but nearly all chinese players barely speak or understand a word in english,sadly.\n\nAnyone here know why? Like dont they learn it all in school? ?
Relevant username.
Funny thing it actually has.
He's Icefrog's darling, probably one of his favorite heroes. He makes sure the hero is playable every patch.  \nSee also: antimage and QoP.
A C E
i actually think sumail is amazing in the offlane. 
Irrelevant contribution
I laughed out loud.
You can blink from secret shop high ground straight in last I checked. No reason to stand in the open. \n\nPlace scan at the choke points not on the pit, at least in my experience watchers near ancient camp and on higher ground are much more likely than someone just outside. \n\nI think the game should just shout that X player wasted their team’s scan scanning Rosh pit and sooner than later things would change. 
Like that one weeb loser on team liquid^^miracle and his 4 gay friends with the phantom 6th guy who does all the work but doesnt play.
Like your flair is, was, and will be.
s        
Why would mmr have any relation to how many reports you have?
But he's such a funny guy, why not?
thats not true, DOta can attract new players if valve would step down of their high fucking horse and provide content.\n\nWe had NO  CONTENT for 4 months now. 4 fucking months, a lesser game would be dead,hell Pubg lost a million peak players daily in a few weeks.
Nobody cares.
That's not a throw...
He totally deserve all those misery cause he has been super toxic already even before TI7
What the fuck are you talking about. SF was garbage for ages, AM has had like a 44% winrate in 5k for months, and QoP is only a stable hero because she's hard to gank.
ROFL, u didn't understand me. I am not defending chappie, i just wanted to point out that He failed to ruin and punished only himself, the rest didn't have to play with him, good for them. 
You still can't blame fear though since he can and has played just about every hero. 
Considering the fact most Chinese pros couldn't even order in a restaurant in English, I have no idea where you got that foolish notion of yours from.
breaking the "asian kid math savant" stereotype right here i salute you sir
But 9/10 someone is standing outside the pit for vision so it’s kind of useful...
i bet 90% of all these players complaining about sf pickers on their team dont know how to play with an sf on their team
Not sure why this bs is voted as an excuse for such behavior lmao, most of us dota 2 players don't earn money nor have a team and u don't see thousands of players destroying their items raging and abandoning constantly like him. 
You can just leave the party
Nerfed? It  has 17% miss chance now which in dota language means 100%, so its OP af my man 
7 years please tell me what "CONTENT" valve had done to attract NEW PLAYERS since dota2 launched in 2011? Don't give me those "compendium, battle pass, custom games" that kinda bullshits.
Dude, I think you are literally new hitler /s
THIS! Fucking canceL^^ Likes Low!? WHAT THE FUCK! I'm a fan now.\n
It's quite a lot, but not really on the level of "top tier" player. 900k a year is like upper-medium level. Sure enough for a 22yo gamer though.

&gt; good chemistry\n\nod just shouting over fogged's analysis half the time becoming very tiresome. hate when anyone does it, just let people speak.
Can you guys stop relating the behaviour in game to his personal life. Now I m no supporter of chappies, but unless you are his physician you have no right to comment if he has a disabily. Moreover he is not even griefing in this game. Abandoning game comes with its own demeritts and he choses to accept the demerits. Unless valve forces each abandons to be a serious issues, I guess what he did was within Valve's limits of playing game in this case.(obviously not when griefing.)
No offense but how  the fuck do you guys even played this game. that ui looks so ugly and invasive. the whole bottom of the screen looks cluttered.  \n\nThis is the kind of thing that makes me laugh whenever dota 2 purists start talking about pre 7.00 era. \n\n
thats not even a dick wtf you complaining about
Can confirm my SF always ultis not 'inside' the enemy hero but a bit further away next to him lmao
Dont forget Earthshaker with his antimage spell shield level 25 talent
there's an option to only match with people not in a party.
What, a liar? 
Lumi is probably gonna be forced in there somewhere I fear.
They do get paid you know? Unlike you and your family. 
For what it's worth, fogged was drinking his monster. They don't automatically crumple when they're empty lol, OD just likes to crumple them for fun... Fogged could have his drink empty as well
You have serious mental issues for giving a fuck. 
Well, I made the thread so yes! Made myself chuckle (bad quality i know) so thought it might make some others laugh with a bit more exposure. I'm sorry if that annoyed or offended you, friend. It seems some people enjoyed it, I don't know.
&gt; Does it matter if they play in the west?\n\nUnless you are some other country citizen with your whole family not being accessible physically(I won't say it is unlikely for a dota fan to assault said player's family). Like there are already players being harassed for just performing poorly(which btw even dogshit performance is obviously many times better then being a sellout). Not joking when I say the direct kin of the player will actually be despised by their own relatives, and face(面子 which is reputation according to google translate) is very important to the chinese. Which is why you never see any of the CN players ever joining non CN teams. Language is a barrier is not the most cricual factor of them not venturing out, as some of the sea players can easily solve the barrier etc chuan mushi ohiyo iceiceice all of them are chinese, just not mainland chinese. In fact all you see is these players going to CN and play, not the reverse. Plus weren't there also talks of how HAO was anti iceiceice juz because he isn't holding CN citizenship.\n\n&gt;By ignorant people maybe. China is not a communist country, it's authoritarian/socialistic.\n\nlol I nv said they are. But a very very very large portion of the population are still definitely behaving in a certain manner even after being "freed". And they are definitely nationalist. I mean why do you think DAC is the only tournament that even bother to match valve's major when ESL just laugh at the community after getting away with hosting minor that are labeled as major? Because again "face" is very important to them and they cannot allow China to be humiliated. And turning coat is also seen as a humiliation.\n\nedit: oh and if you see /u/Archyes's comment below yours, you will see that the chinese is already calling EE a dog(just for being a chinese, but not a mainland one at that lol) 
League of legends is the largest esport game in the world(yuck). China is 90% of league's playerbase. Therefore, the chinese league of legends competition is the most viewed esports competition in the world
Rofl so more spaces equal clean? Yeah sure m8
1. What a big pile of dung. Either the family is disgraced by the player not having a proper white-collar job or he isn't and he earns a lot of money. In that case do you think some elderly people in the neighbourhood give a flying fuck about whether fy used Doom on Linkens? LMAO get real.\n\n2. I never said you said China were a communist country, read it again. You said China is considered communist and I replied China is considered communist by ignorant people.\n\n3. Again, another big dump of shit. Read what communism is about. I will give you a few hints - one of the main points of communism is equality and no classes. Now look at the wealth gap in China. Production is not collectivized. Companies owned by the state doesn't redistribute the wealth. \n\n4. Yeah, EE gives so many fucks about Chinese calling him a dog.
He was a toxic asshole waaaay before TI7.

The feeling was definetely NOT mutual for SEA peeps, lol...SEA peeps arent like that, its pretty common knowledge that Chinese people in general look down on SEA peeps due to the tone of the skin, being that darker means you work outside/farm/labour a lot...\n\nAnd if the feeling was "mutual" as you say for the SEA peeps it wouldnt have been much of a drama for teams with SEA players to not scrim other Chinese teams.
USELESS
meese
Hey, Volvo, wtf?\n\nWhy u didn't fix it?
When you get a ultra kill you also get a triple kill so instead of ultra kill triple kills are counted as they are more common!
For sure. Honestly, a 6-month break from Dota might be exactly what the dude needs. Forced to step away and hopefully figure out how to control his rage then, if he wants, come back and fulfill his potential as a player :( 
these cheats are beyond useless, any gamesense what so ever is better than these. These look so distracting.\n\nso basically if you were 2k these would help you, if you were 6k like me these would be annoying you.\n\nedit: ok i'll give props to the teleport thing
This looks like and ad from the cheat
Wtf is this ?? SMFH
not if you have map awareness and you know how to play the map, i basically always know where someone is farming. And this is quite a common thing for most people in high mmr to know.\n\nWhy would you need a cheat to tell you something you should already know.\n\nOh it's it's 13 minutes, antimage just hot his battlefury, i wonder where he is, no way he could be farming safelane jungle.\n\noh it's 10 minutes invoker has his midas and wave is pushed in the midlane, no way he could be going to the hard camp to midas it.\n\nbut of course the average 2k reddtors can't see something obvious like this.

When you get a rampage, you also get a kill. So kills should be counted since they are the most common of them all!
&gt; Why would you need a cheat to tell you something you should already know\n\nBecause execution is a skill. Typical9k redditor, praise pro for having the presence of mind to create clutch play, then process to say anyone can do that since those information (mana,cd) are already there.
Trust me, if u were anywhere close to 6k you would understand how useful they become in many situations.
How the fuck that kind of cheap and stupid joke appear in front page
Its actually Walri not walrusses
He was obviously being sarcastic 
I know he's joking but I think he's serious about OD not knowing
Is it really a gank if 4 people are there?
You need some reading comprehension 
1k for knowing u are tilting trash... EXPENSIVE 
IS that OD casting? He doesn't seemed hyped like he usually is.
Nice 1v1 man, fun watching you two play
I know right.
Same.
rawdota on suicide watch
Its actually octopedes not octupi. Oh wait nope its octopuses now because who cares what the word originates from we are in the current year and it makes no sense to mix up English just for the sake of it. 
Oh I totally get that. You just won't get the karma that way :P 
You usually do actually. A lot of times it's not the first clip to be upvoted, it's the best one (and happily so).\n\nedit : unless mods just delete without checking.
People can just click watch full video to go back a bit if they really care.\n\nDid not know that :) Thx\n\nSomeone posted it in the comments
cus its not european dota\n\nmiracle razes neutrals = odpixel loses his mind
I kinda hate this in dota. U got game in the bag and 2 enemy heroes casualy relocate and finish your trone. It was awesome and those fights were so tight, but for me its kinda moodkiller when u get base raced after wrecking oponent.
Dont get me wrong it is indeed what hero does. I am not sold on that talent from io where it goes minigun. I usualy percive IO as taxy-battery. Kinda hits too personal in times where troll was imba and it usualy were not good memories of your base getting crushed by Troll (with or without Io). Also did they have one more tp ready ? \n\nEdit: Spelling
Yup.
I dream of a day when gamers don't go apeshit of one human being able to dance- or act without being autistic. 
It the caster pronouncing his name right?   Could it possibly be Yeah!  War!   Instead of YAWHAr      Less WHAT, more WOR?    Has this already been addressed and I'm late to the party?
i guess you need to give props to the IMT koreans, but KoreanBarBeQue team is too stronk
Wtf man I remember playing with you like 5 years ago...are you playing with rtz now?
That’s literally not true at all. If sammyboy was simply a better player why did he lose two games? And you can beat many an SF who is more skilled than you in general if you learn to win the first wave. Getting level 2 before your opponent in an SF 1v1 can be an auto win most of the time
I guess that kind of is the definition, hah, but typically in DotA it's one, sometimes two heroes that help in a gank.
xP
Man, the things casters have to do these days..
&gt;it's like he's 1v1ing himself emotionally\n\nor maybe he's just bad
Anyone else think that TB should have taken the 5 sec cooldown sunder talent instead? 
win 2-0, lose 1-2, lose LAN. 1st loss on a "double elimination" bracket, but still eliminated. classic Dota 2 double elimination.
oof!
Its that most teams in other regions play poorly and disruption punishes that heavily that why teams that play against og wouldnt pick it and og dont pick them because they dont need it
OD is killing it here you dumbfuck. I dream of a day when shitters like you can be less insecure. 
This shit is so old is not even funny anymore. 
I wouldn't really call it a gank if 8 out of the 10 available heroes show up in the lane. The dire was more than a little slow though.
Gotta love a guy who's completely willing to make a fool of himself for the amusement of others
If IO had sold majority of his items and got a deso, there would of been nothing Radiant could of done because the tower / ancient would of died so much faster.
Rekt
god knows why you are downvoted
VIVON ZULUL
Proof?
Dire throne still had quite a lot of hp left at the end. I don't think the 2.5s would have made a difference. It was either they kill the troll or he kills their ancient - whichever happens first. Euls isn't helping kill the troll. Maybe if they bought multiple dagons though
I was thinking aghs for tusk would have helped immensely.
I wanna sex that gurl
Oh great, another thing broken by Source 2.\n\nWhat was even the point of that update?
To force the potsto PCs from net cafes to upgrade?\n\nTo rid the servers of people who have shitnet for a few hours?
Real question is....\nDid you win?
No flame but you guys are tunnel visioning this. I mean he didn't have to astral himself if he was fast enough to realize that no projectile went off qop = no gank
one of the most Underestimated Talent QOP Fear. idk why most people get the fcking linken. its an AOE CC and at a low cool down. getting octarine and arcane rune at late game you can basically solo control a whole team
Or aghs if he could, walrus kick could buy a significant time
Joke =/= Funny.

That's what they do during Evolution, which is biggest fighting game tournament of the year encompassing games like street fighter, tekken, ssbm, etc. If you make it to the grand final from the lower bracket, you need two sets of wins to take first place. On the other hand, if you came from the upper bracket, you only need one set of win.\n\nTrue double elimination brackets are fucking hyyyypeeeeeee, but it's not plausible with dota bc dota takes way too long. 
lame like ur name
I’ve crushed his smurf trench league account all the time as invoker, so easy to beat Henry “rawdota”.
True..\n\nThat's too bad actually, i mean it's almost guaranteed that secret and liquid will be in top 4, maybe even playing the grand finals...\n\nAnd thats taking away points from weaker teams that need them more
IMT had to play more matches thru the finals cuz they lost once idiot
syndLUL
I didn't miss the reference. It's a bad reference, as it's based on a misinformation.
He was sacked because that's how he wanted the team to play around him, they tried to have him hard carry and he failed. He's just not a 1 player, he's more like a 3 playing the safelane. 
Qualify to a Minor only to have to go up against Liquid, Secret and OG.\n\nWell at least the Scandic Hotell close to the DH studios has a good buffet breakfast.

Laning mechanics Are probably around 5% of dota.. So pretty irelevant.. saying He Is 6k SKILL level just because He can Lane Is pure bullshit
Wow, what a surprise.
It's pronounced YAA-VER\nNot YE-VAAR
+ 2x 5 man ulti
 I mean almost all hero missing from lanes and he is still playing from downhill and close uphill. It's not much about bracket, people do this silly mistakes over and over.
riiight, so all those comps where he's left to farm offlane on a core hero alone with no help were reflective of what you said /s\n

/rambling\n\nI can't believe PT and Radi early build made it into Dota2 in 2k16. Or that it got dropped thereafter. Why would you ever make phase on spec, when you have the +MS ability and you need him buffed up for that massive dps from dispersion? I follow treads after radi with bm and hot. Never fails. I also don't understand why people would make vanguard on him, instead of pure +hp. Doesn't the blocked dmg not reflect back onto the enemies?\nFull disclosure:\nI just recently transferred from DotA. Played a game or two with Spec here, didn't notice him being that much more nerfed. I used to really own with Spec in DotA - the classic 1v5 teamfight x 2/3/4&gt;win with 4 feeders, game ruin. I guess I'll start spamming him here. I just like to play a lot of heroes right now to get caught up with the changes, or I would have already.\n\n*Out of curiosity, how did he get nerfed since two years ago?*
smurf trash
Im a 4k5 shitlord, played against Miracle 2 days ago, killed him 3 times, lost game. Im a happy man.
Flash farm, wave clear, stun, can fight early and scales very well into late game.
Because he has everything to lose. If he loses to a non tier 1 player it will be talked to death. Also Arteezy has lost 1v1s before on multiple occasions. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1mvh63/the_moment_rtzs_1v1_mid_reign_ended/) for instance happened and it spawned a meme and is still mentioned today even though it was 4 years ago.
Nobody gives a shit. Maybe you and like 4 other people do. Congrats.
But what if OD doesn't astral himself (maybe shopping/very short burst of inattention)? The slow is nice, sure, but I'd wager he would've lived.
Liquid is the best teamfighting team imo. 
Not sure what your point is. What you're saying is also definitely not true, people do give a shit. I actually don't. I'm simply saying if he would lose there would be reddit threads and memes saying "rtz lost to Sammboy, washed up lol" etc. Things like that can get to people, no matter how much experience they have.
and yet, your badge is an average of your party and solo MMR, so you DO have to play with parties if you want to clim or it will be twice as hard because you have to compensate your party MMR with your solo.

I wouldn’t say being antisocial is part of the definition of a weeb, I know too many that fit in perfectly fine while being openly weeb, it used to be about associating very strongly with an idealized idea of Jap culture by being misinformed via just consuming anime, but these days any semi-serious anime fan seems to call themselves a weeb, the term has really lost it’s heaviness over time. 
To be fair it's been years since a carry that needs babysitting is in the meta. 
Won a 25 min game against that bastard. We steam rolled every lane and hero early and he STILL managed to hold vs 4 of us for a while and even got return kills with scepter.\n\nBut damn Pugna is strong vs him. Pushes fast to take his towers, nether reveals his location and deala damage, his high int gives him more resistance, being blinded doesnt matter because of the suck, standing in march doesnt matter, and he naturally buys bkb too.
My point is that your claim is idiotic. Memes happen all the time about literally everything. No pro with a basic amount of experience would ever get nervous to the point that it affects his play because someone could joke about it. There is literally nothing on stake. And if you think otherwise you are delusional.   \n\nGood day, sir.
And the God of grammar smiled down on 9180365437518 this day. For he was a good disciple. He has studied the way - and is his mission to spread the good word.\n\nHowever, the God of grammar thinks you can be a little less of a meany. \n

There is no secret quest because they changed how patching work. So instead of it being 7.08b, it is 7.09. Which means that two weeks from now you will be playing on 7.10.\n\nThe quests are from another time. You can meme one into the game given how Valve likes to appeal to this place but as of now there isn't one.

If you didn't read Navy Navi ur not a dota 3 player 
Does...does this mean Synderen is Tidehunter?
I don't really care too much about the quest tbh. If people have fun doing it then go for it.\n\nAlso don't know how much historical precedence comes into play when talking about Valve. They can make some really questionable decisions (For example, most people made the safe assumption that diretide would be annual. Turned out it wasn't). I always take stuff like this with a grain of salt when it comes to Valve, i.e. don't believe it til I see it.\n\nEDIT: You are probably right about historical precedent to be honest. For me personally though, I will still take everything Valve does with a grain of salt.
King Leoric, The Skeleton King
I am more concerned about their actual game effecting lies like "6 month bans" "language settings matter more" "improved detection and punishment" "recalibration"
So this means Synderen is secretly a watermelon???1?
Kunkka led an armada, Alliance has Armada
Kunkka is a fictional character, man.

the game is already lost, doesnt matter how hard they fuck up past that point.
nice try, dont be too hard on him next time
I'm not saying quit. Im saying in all likely hood you have lost. There is an off chance that you win, but you most likely lost.
Is it me but all this secret quest stuff is just a hoax from Valve to use players for bug finding purpose xD

As an Ancient player who played against you not so long ago, this is painful for me to see as ive never had an easier game.
Meanwhile the 5 position supp controlling lanes making plays roaming, stacking, buying detection, warding all game, gets brushed aside as if nonexistent.
dude before u posted this i thought op is trolling cuz i saw gaben for 1 frame during that white flash\n
What's the point of these commendations? Does anyone at all ever care about them when glimpsing them on another account?\n\nThe fact that they don't is just strange how we care when we get them.
If you really think valve would ever rise you in the ranks for being a good boy, and if that information proved out to be right and it ever got out... I don't need to go on here. That's not possible.
LOL EGSDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
hijacking top comment to say, hello dongtales viewers HeyGuys
I think it's a waste of time.\n\nI also think they should make separate brackets for people who don't mind flaming and those who do. I can pretty much guarantee the church boys are going to suck ass on average.\n\nNot to mention the Facebooky quality of this system where every game you get someone asking for "likes". This is proof of how bad that player really is in essence, if nothing else.
Next you'll call me Hitler.
Aren't you smart. You're not toxic anymore if you willingly engage in a behaviour with fellow consenting people. Consider that for a second, be an adult.
Pointless.\n\nYou have to state what the commendations are for, liking someone for not flaming, or admiring their skill. Then you can claim the value you speak of.
I'd say clockwerk and dark seer.
Because you're comparing blowjobs to commendations.\n\nThe irony of you trying to sound like a smartaleck while making such proposterous analogies is thoroughly entertaining.
!redditsilver\n
How am I trolling? You're not even making sense.\n\nAll I said was you're making preposterous analogies akin to comparing someone you disagree with with Hitler, something very common on the internet.\n\nWhat do you mean by your Hitler comment?
I, as a solo support, managed to corner, bully, blame, humiliate and mentally destroy my carry bf spec. We lost, but I had fun in the process and two commends afterwards.\n\n\n Fuck that build btw.

Guess you figured out that better go for the game that has longer life span , rather then stick to dota ...\n\nbut yeah ... enjoy digging a comment  i made 3 months ago mr big dick efamous tortalini something something ... pathetic kid .
What does it matter when you're bad at the game. 
I actually almost never flame in a game, and always try to reason with my teammates that they shouldn't alienate each other. Because I think it makes for a better game to not be "toxic" in those instances where their flaming obviously interacts in a negative way with their loyalty to the team.\n\nThere are two problems I find with the current system. That there isn't a mode to play with other people who don't mind flaming, since there's no possible argument against that, and that this commendation system is utterly useless and simply annoying, in addition to making weaker players think that if they get plenty of commendations they achieve some sort of value independent of their actual skill, which they, of course, don't.\n
Someone's got a case of the mondays.\n\nWhy'd you post this? It's clearly not to be funny. You just trying to make the guy above you feel bad?\n\nYou should be ashamed.
&gt; Other comments you've left make that statement incredibly difficult to believe.\nWhich ones and how?\n\n&gt;There actually does exist a system in which people play with other flamers.\n\nNot what I proposed. If you're talking about low-priority, that's obviously not the same. I'm talking about a mode with all the same things as normal matchmaking, where you can play AP, RD and CM on MMR, just with people who don't mind flaming and where you can't bitch about it, literally, as in making reports, since you go to play there willingly, and no one is stopping you from playing in the no-flame zone instead.\n\n&gt;You get matched with nicer people based on your behavior score, the more commendations you receive and the overall nicer you are, the better your behavior score, and therefore the more people you have in your games that are nice. If you are constantly finding yourself in games with flamers, just sounds to me like your behavior score is low, bringing us back to what I said earlier about you likely not being as nice as you make yourself out to be.\n\nSource needed for claims relating to who you get matched with. As for your claims about me, I quite clearly told you what I think about the viable way to play - if you're flaming *and* you're not playing with your team because you're upset at them, that's a problem. If you can flame and play well, then I don't care.\n\n&gt;About weaker players getting commendations, commendations don't improve your skill, literally, everyone knows this. No one is using '# of commends' as their primary talking point. \n\nI get plenty of commendations and none of them are for "niceness", just for successfully carrying people to success.\n\nhttps://snag.gy/LhM5zR.jpg\n\nI barely even talk in Dota, as I wrongly get grouped with Russians even though I'm of the same cultural, historical and regional ilk as Cancel^^ and w33.\n\n&gt;If someone has a ton of commends and they're in my game, that means they are likely equally skilled with me, and also a nice person, someone I'd very much like to have in my game, let alone my team. \n\nThis is what makes me think you're naive and bad at this game, along with anyone that upvotes you and downvotes me.\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Stop flaming in-game, improve your behavior score, and you'll have better games, commends help improve behavior score, and overall promote positivity in players, therefore they provide value.\n\nUgh, see my earlier point.
What? I thought bf was legit on melee carry kappa
dont forget prophet
&gt;Source needed for claims relating to who you get matched with \n\n[By all means!](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Matchmaking#Behavior_Score) "Match quality is presumably determined by a players behavior score. Players with a high behavior score get matched with other players with a high score and vice versa. "\n\nSecondly, how many commends you get in your weekly report is lovely and all, but how valid of a point could you be making with that if you're using your [smurf](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/851758241) with less than 100 games to make that point? \n\nI have no idea how being matched with Russians is even at all part of this discussion given that we're discussing behavior score and it's impact, not servers or whatever else. \n\n&gt;This is what makes me think you're naive and bad at this game, along with anyone that upvotes you and downvotes me. \n\nAt least have the balls to show us your actual profile and not your smurf, then talk.
Look where that got him.
Here's another:  \nAdmiral Kunkka: Has a talent to summon a fleet of ships  \nAdmiral Bulldog: Has a talent for capsizing fleets of ships

This is really beautiful
I just had a huge PM discussion with him.  He thinks there should be a mode with no reports and commendations or low priority that is measured alongside normal and ranked modes. LOL.  So people could just ruin games always and go completely unpunished.  Let alone how his proposal could be taken advantage of in countless ways.  He is truly inept.
DONT BE LIKE MAUT JUST STATING EVERYTHING SO OBVIOUS WITH HIS ANNOYING VOICE. 
CM looks like a little fart in DotA :D
That's not what I said.\n\nI said make a mode with all the same rules in place, except where you're allowed to flame, the same as I made here.\n\nYou haven't offered any argument against that, just thrown strawmans at me. I dare anyone to find a problem with this idea. You get consenting people to play just like everyone else, except they willingly play in an environment where flaming isn't punished in any way.\n\nIf you don't like it, you can still play normally.\n\nIt's the same choice as playing ranked or unranked. It's your choice. It doesn't affect anything. But you're being hysterical and can't address anything I actually say.
Yes, but there's nothing illegal about a fictional character having a rank that exists in real life.
damn old Enigma was ugly :S
boy dude you sure do lose a lot of your smurf games at the crusader rank LOL....
IT'S VOIDWALKER IT'S NOT UGLY\n\nOh and the old Blizzard designs are SO MUCH better than the Valve designs, which are totally bland and not interesting.\nEDIT: Oh and Valve Dota lore sucks too
thats tidehunter photoshop skill....ooh....
seems like you are lucky then, i get reported all the time even if i dont say anything but only in game that we lose.\n\nand regarding blaming russians it seems like they really want the blame because they work hard to make sure everyone has a bad time whenever possible.\n\nafter valve made the matchmaking changes it was MUCH better for a week, almost no game with people that dont speak english and overall a better atmosphere.\n\nthat has changed again, now its back to the state is was before and you gotta have luck that you either have decent russians on your team or no russians at all.
hey, gotta maintain that sweet karma!

&gt; find someone\n\n&gt; ask them to help\n\n&gt; dont listen to reddit
People don't like this guy so they want him banned pretty much
Cool repost dude. Have a upvote. I'm not even joking. Just take the karma. It's yours. Spend it on an actual controversial post that divides the community, i want you to. 
Must be hard being this dense :^) \n\nHe's not talking about kunkka, dude. 
Dota heroes are underpowered, no talents. They can't win.
Kinda shits me the wc3 terrain is actually dota2
Still not going to support Facebook or ESL while they are partnered. Sorry. Hope the 7mil was worth it.
Ye like we need encouragement for people to build bfury on Tide.
Quality advice right here.

Why is this getting downvoted?
That’s a permaban
There’s also safe lane prophet, jungle prophet, mid prophet to go with the off lane prophet
still not watching on facebook lul suck my dick zuckerberg
fuck facebook
the real question is why this is a problem....
Can you leave him alone for a day omg? Reddit found another punching bag after CCnC
Still either gonna watch in-game or on Twitch, I'm not getting zucked any time now. :)
Facebook again ? Why not on an actual game streaming platform .
You *are* fun to play with when you're good.\n\nIMO, only skill matters. So insofar as your behaviour affects the outcome of the game, I'm with you, but where it doesn't, no.

I'll wait for next event, fuck ESL and fuck facebook.
This is all great and stuff, but I won't support facebook.
microstuttering and buffering every second on 480p. This is a gigabit connection I have available to me, yet video is stuttering and buffering at 480p. In 2018. What a hot mess.
i still dont want to watch it on fb, sorry
yeah , and it's called nostalgia \n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/5jJUhjw8c2U/maxresdefault.jpg
its stuttering and buffing already and it hasnt even started yet.Garbage fb stream like always.\n
Dota  1 gona win the heroes wer too op
im sorry, the stream does not work on mobile. the mobile site most definitely does not without pestering me to install the facebook app. the desktop site viewed on mobile cannot load the stream and the ui is completely broken
gtfo ESL u had ur chance
Sick post brah
Inb4 blizzard sues you
what de fuk is that gorgcc with no kills but 11 assists HAHAHAH
Maybe I am, since I expected too much from the dota sub.
Good to see you're listening to issues, but I still refuse to use facebook's platform. I only use facebook at all because I have to to be able to organise things, I'm sure as hell never using it for entertainment. \n\nESL, you seem to misunderstand your audience. Dota 2 fans, especially those who are interested in the competitive scene tend to be tech savvy and many have activist tendencies (at least to support if not do so themselves). Partnering with a large corporate who's regularly accused of privacy breaches and scene as an enemy of internet freedom and anonymity was possibly the worst analysis of a target audience I've seen in a long time. \n\nYou need to sit your leadership team down and have a good long look at the decision making process in your company, because clearly it totally broke down as soon as big names and monetary figures got thrown around.
Yep... Sorry but stream on fb is aweful...
well stream quality is shit on fb
GO AWAY NEWFAG
What's the link supposed to explain to me? I've been playing dota since 2013. The last time I played warcraft 3 was *one year ago*. Nothing to do with nostalgia.  \n\n
Ah man, isnt this a blast, a group of people who are way overpayed for what they do sat together in a room to figure out how they could continue to fuck us over with facebooks weak streaming platform, but try to win people over. Their answer: a motherfucking twitlonger sized reddit post explaining that they care and they tried to iron out a couple of the endless issues there is with facebook streaming. Good fucking job, you bettered a couple of the bulletpoints from your whiteboard so your stream went from complete fucking dogshit with and exclamation mark to complete fucking dogshit no exclamation mark. But the goal wasnt to actually make the streaming platorm better, it was just to have a few bulletpoints to put into this post so you could pretend like you care. If you actually gave a shit you would just stream it on twitch, cause you know, twitch has the best viewing experience. Anyways, i am gonna watch whoever streams it on twitch, even if that means i have to endure the shitshow that is admiralbulldogs twitch stream (which i like for entertainment, i just prefer something more proffesional for tournaments, different strokes).\nTL,DR: Fuck ESL, this is just a way for them to pretend like they tried real hard to make things better, when they actually are just trying to get people to sympathize with their moneygrabbing ways.
How shit can you be to partner up with one of the biggest companies in the world and not have a stream avialble on ps4 or xbox. In 2018 anno domini. Fucks sake la.
Can you just fuck off, I won't watch it on the fucking facebook. Fuck you esl and your facebook.
Old tidehunter with quelling blade or battlefury had a sick attack animation, literally beyblade.

You seem to have a lot of trouble recognizing a silly joke. Genuinely curious, are you autistic? 
wtf is wrong with your stream, there is always a micro stutter every ten second, before you say isp bad, twitch and youtube is working perfectly on 720p\n\npls fix it ESL 
The names are still there.
It's fucking lagging. I gave it a try and it's unwatchable. I'm out.

Facebook LUL\n\nhttp://www.tomshardware.com/news/facebook-loses-belgium-privacy-lawsuit,36540.html
man I like the old models so much more.. big nostalgia plus
I don't want to personally attack you Johannes or any employees, but want to use this post to express my frustration.\n\nJust a big fuck you Facebook.\nI just spend 50 minutes trying to figure out how to watch the stream using a tablet (kindle fire hdx 7 with android 7.1.2 lineageOS). I cannot fucking get it too work, because either I'm a total moron or its too hard to get a mobile friendly and intuitive user experience in 2018.\n\nBecause if I go on the ESL stream page, the video automatically wants to open up the Facebook app - which I willingly download, but I am not willed to login to watch a stream - I personally prefer to get my data to be recorded/taken without my consent. So I refuse to login into my Facebook account, which sucks, because there is no way to go on and watch the stream without login (take my word, don't make me take a screenshot for this...) in the app.\n\nSo let's try it without the Facebook app, using the desktop version of the stream link (either Facebook or ESL) in the chrome browser, while it does not automatically redirect me to the fb app, it simply tells me that the embedded video cannot be played. So that's sth I guess?\n\nSo after wasting my lunch break, I decide to go home early today (meaning in 2-3 hours, missing the first matched) just to watch the event on my fucking home PC, because I'd rather not use the one from work and the bullshit doesn't work (for me) on the tablet, which I brought to with me for exactly non-work related things.\n\nTo sum up my experience with the Facebook stream: fuck you.\nFuck whoever made that decision.\nFuck the reasons behind it (hint: Facebook is not the future, it used to be... in 2010...)\nFuck all the people who stand behind it and indulge this monstrosity.\n\nI will probably get massive down votes, because of my mad ranting and people are right in doing so. I am really mad and fed up with this crap, but I am probably not the only one.
Facebook keeps preventing me from doing this, keeps saying that I'm trying to hack someone/something and that they therefore aborted all requests.
1.Sound mutes when i switch stream and i have to refresh the page to fix it or to even find the overlay for the sound settings\n\n2.Its impossible double click to go full screen or reduce to small screen (very annoying when using a wireless mouse and you constantly have to move across the room for a quick peek at the other game)" \n\n3.YOU ACTUALLY CANT CHANGE VOLUME WHEN IN FULL SCREEN; COMBINE THAT WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO GO SMALL SCREEN WITH PROBLEM 2 AND THIS IS WHAT I LISTEN TO IF I WANT TO REDUCE THE VOLUME, get it? VERY ANNOYING I HOPE YOU GET MY POINT

Works absolutely fine for me. Better than twitch.
You can change volume in full screen, what the hell are you smoking?
Stream is good but I am 100% missing the interaction in the chat. FB chat is just horrible. And even if you try as ESL, you wont change that, it's just another mentality because you have to be logged in with you real name. Thats a WORLD of difference.
Ahhh the good ol ballerina tidehunter
I'm on mobile (samsung Galaxy s6) and for me the esl website either doesnt work or it takes me to the google play store to download the fb app.

Same here. Can't even watch 10 seconds straight. Switched to Twitch.

They can't.\n\nSome of the heroes like ~~Yurnero and~~ Pitlord is using the name of a WarCraft 3 Hero, which makes it Blizzard property. \n\n
Same here
I have the same issue as you sir. Not here for drama but for a fix if there is one. Am also watching on 480p and every 2 minutes or so ... it just like slows down for a couple of seconds ... stutters and then its back to normal. Quite annoying to be honest. 
#FUCK ESL. 
The all caps babyrage tiltfest suggests that.
I'd rather clean a gas station toilet with my tongue than log in to facebook.
Its DotA
Is this supposed to be a sarcastic post?
Let's see if i understood this right. Since he wrote in caps he must be able to change the audio setting. Alright
You get reported when you lose because you are toxic &amp; tilt but when you win you generally carry your teammates :) \nToxic people are affiliated with being alwful human beings but we actually do it just because we want to win so much. I know how people say that it is just game but hey life is a game too and if you don't aim to win with everything you have every time i feel like something is wrong with you!\nSource: I am the same (10 reports, 20 commends sumarries)
Whoa bro be careful, it's dangerous to go against the reddit circlejerk.\n\nEveryone knows that once a player does a bad thing he's always a piece of shit in every game forever, and that valve should take personal action against this one player because redditors made threads about it.
how to watch on Ps4?
On the Facebook app on my Pixel XL it's difficult to find out when games are live (as in the B stream link doesn't work when I try and click it)
ill get downvoted for it, but this is witchhunting for me
Yeah do the work for Facebook because they are not smart enough to figure out how to stream.
Seems so much better than Genting! Good guy ESL listens to the plebs, FeelsGoodMan
No, you don't understand it right.
can't wait for WC3 remaster  \nsupposedly all maps will work  \ngonna play dota 1 since valve ruined dota 2  
Tried to watch a play in dota a few days ago and i have no idea what i was looking at 
GranDGrant participated?\n\nWell, anyone but him please.\n
my feedback is fuck Facebook and ESL
True. But the Invoker counterpoint is his "insane" or quality cosmetics. Invoker is better in that regard but Tinker's TI7 set and immortals are pretty peng.
CCnC deserved it too. But he is better now.
You can't just ban Iceiceice but if you will ban one Iceiceice hero ban Timber specially if you rely on physical damage.\n\nThis is how Mineski played early this season they are confident with their draft and just execute it unlike when they had Winter which is pretty much a disaster since they are confuse in draft and playstyle.
If clock used smoke he would have lived
Yes, and crazy stuttering when it is 'playing'
Even though you are a better player, meta likely wins
Today has been NA LUL so far
Winter still their coach
Other than GranDGranT, these casters performed rather poorly.
We need "Complaint | ESL" flair
I am really really trying to watch it, but man this is triggering to say the least.\n\nThe stream half the time loads without the botton right options, so as it is muted by default (for god knows what reason), i can't turn the volume up. To fix that, i need to fully reload the page some times and pray it works. \n\nThe quality looks great now, but the stream just stops itself out of nowhere and never reconect again, there isnt even a pause/play button to try to fix it (even as the pause option do exist if you right click the stream). Than i am forced to fully reload and deal with the first problem again.\n\nAlso somehow it is crashing the webgl, wich i don't remeber ever happening before.\n\nI am almost giving up on trying cause i am missing more of the games than watching.
I’m but a lowly ancient player but I’ve seen a lot of jungle wk lately what is going on
2 sets, both are garbage. Immortal helmet that looks like shit, boots that give you a special TP.\n\nYippee so amazing cosmetics.
You can actually hear what players are talking while drafting in EG vs LGD on facebook stream.\n\nIntended or not its cool lol
I missed Optic game, but Zai gave his offlane pos to 33?
I feel mineski loses with vs core more times than they win...\n\nBut just another reason not to give players signature heroes...especially into a favourable draft for that hero
You give EG the only hero they can win with , fucking Lycan
lacoste is so cringe :(
Tobi has pretty decent game knowledge 
EG OMEGALUL
i 100% agree man, wc3 is the shit.
Yup, as last time, cleaner than Twitch is for me.
Unwatchable, thanks.
but in reality its viseversa 
Please abandon your next 5 games now.

Na dota t2 dota
is this related to how storm is able to activate his passive while the projectile is in mid-air?
This is pretty annoying but there are ppl casting on twitch. Might give them a try!
Fucking bullshit. I commended both of my supports who ensured I had free farm for 10 min which resulted in me annihilating enemy team as Sven.\n\nAlso when as a solo 5 pos I won mid lane with two rotations mid commended me at the end of the game.\n\nIf you are doinng things right you get commended. Simple as that.
I watch it through live.esl-one.com via Incognito Mode and it's awesome at 480p. It's way better than Twitch at 360p. And my ISP is shit and awful.
Can you please let me watch the fucking stream in mobile with quality fucking options, please? The facebook app doesn't have any. I disabled the FB app (system app can't uninstall) but this shit redirect is still there.
its not oficcially rigging. But he asked people that do not even dota, its like letting NA vote for EU president, nobody wants that right?

It's actually hilarious how many times I see people complain about these fictional eg fans.  For every "annoying eg fan" there are 20 people complaining about them.
Fear cant win with the only hero in his pool
just asking them is deceitful, it doesnt matter if they vote or not
stop overrating na dota.just call it what it is garbage tier dota.
never satisfied are you?
This gotta be the worst line when it comes to predictions.
This is priceless. I was on the fence with this topic of calling predictions based off likelihood. I'll leave the options open in play by play. Thank you so much!
i dont fucking care about karma downvote me as much as you want
Grand
Yet the magnificent OG got stomped hard as well. 
not even in NA
EG please just fucking disband, ok?\nCan't even watch this shitty team anymore
There is literally no good offlaner in EG now.. they pick mid hero and core hero to play offlane.. thats bad.. decrease their hero pool by drafting like that.. im sad with this new EG..
Oh but they got stomped. Chen only delayed the game with those saves.
LOL
No it's not it's your internet connection, fuck off.\n\nCan this dumb circle jerk be gone already? I'm watching in 720 and it's clean.
really dont understand why fnatic is being praised to high heavens all of a sudden. they havent proven shit yet and seem to be really inconsistent. 
Grant, Moxxi, and Breaky were the standouts to me. Always happy to hear their casts. Everyone else was fine but not a serious draw.
lebron now playing for na'vi after winning the mvp for nba all star game
There's no way to pause the video so that I can alternate tabs while watching? Really Facebook? Really? How can something so simple not be done there but instead I can mute the stream but still burn through my bandwidth...
NA LUL
You're right, Europe doesn't have the top two DPC places right now.  Europe shit region confirmed.
Don't worry. They'll have Lumi as "analyst" next game.
They are never satisfied rofl
Fear was known for being a versatile player that could make anything work. Now hes a liability to his team, 3 or 4 heroes in his 'A-tier' pool. They pick for him heroes that dont feed, not heroes that change the game. Defensive and stale drafting. 
chad invoker=bulldog invoker\n\nmonkaS dont ban pls 
NA Dota is shit x 20.
EG is a defensive and stale team.
Virgin finnish nolife fuck xD
IMO Fear has never been good since the returned to EG as a player.
virgin tinker a soyboy
I really tried to give it a shot. Because i wanted to hear Cap&amp;Blitz again. But the stuttering of the stream is a shit viewing experience and i gave up. And i have no problems on twitch. 
I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot of these until ESL get their shit together and use a real streaming platform like Twitch instead of this FB garbage. When I want to see how my Aunt Sue in Ohio is doing, I use Facebook. When I want to watch esports, I use Twitch or YouTube. Fuck ESL and fuck FB.
From destroying NA teams to losing to them, and getting shat on. Washed up players too

NA doto is truly the weakest region, i think with even ping they would lose to SA doters
Is this a old or new copypasta?
http://steamcommunity.com/id/thehunkysquirrel/inventory/#440\n\nHave fun.
Why does NA have 3 slots anyway????????? They should be given SA treatment, pretty appropriate given their playerbase size and avg team tier level
Watched the NA qualifier for Dreamhack recently and it was really astounding how low quality those games were. It often looked more like a 3k pub honestly...
Nope.
The fact that this is a front page post on reddit is pretty sad.
NA worst region in the Universe
NA DOTA in 2k18 OMEGALUL 
Nope, techies. 
Isn't EG Tier 1 team? /s
Oh no, NA lost 3 BO1s! What an enormous sample size to be able to draw definitive conclusions from!
Like when? Last I remember most top posts that feature Sumail/RTZ are actually good plays, things that deserve being front page (such as RTZ tree placement to survive gank at mid).\n\nSumail front page was him flamebaiting with a twitter post and reddit shooting it to the front page by taking it.\n\nThis post is literally something you get from Twitch chat.
His comment gets upvotes. Yours gets downvotes this subreddit is infected with EU cucks
He's gotta go fast
Telegram squad Iran branch reporting in.
lately he is more sonic 06 then sonic boom....!...
Theres some mad salt in here for whats *pretty much* just a meme.

He sanic
I've written so many hate-posts about fucking Invoker and they get downvoted to oblivion every time. The reasons in the pic aren't even a meme, they are legitimately all true and super fucking annoying. The hero does everything and does it better then heroes that are created specifically for a purpose. \n\nNeed a pusher? You don't need a Lycan, just get Invoker and push with forge spirits and alacrity tanks. Need nukes? Who needs Zeus, you have global pure damage nuke man who can insta-kill any single (or multiple) hero with a combo. Need disable? Just fucking cold snap everyone, the most balanced spell in the game.\n\nAnd one thing I'll never understand is that not only does he have 10 insanely good spells, he gets the 3 orb things on top of them that basically give him free insane stats for no fucking reason at all.\n\nI've hated this hero since Dota 1 and I wouldn't waste another thought about it if he was just taken out of the game.
Yeah you guys *definitely* don't have an irrational hatred of NA. Yeah this is perfectly normal. Obviously it's not enough for NA to lose, you must also make fun of them for losing./s\n\nYou guys are honestly pathetic.

I think you should give up the Sonic analogies since they really haven't released a good game since the old 2D ones
THIS IS NOT THURSDAY
You gotta love the "congratulaions on completing sex correctly," it is an achievement I have yet to complete.
it is a bug yes indeed, i was overhyped. Man but the momories... i want to believe! So i post everysingle think it could be :D 
Three words that have been used over and over to trash a region and further a retarded rivalry over which continent is better than a video game. And making fun of NA going beyond Dota is part of the problem, it alienates a significant section of the community and those people will feel resentful after hearing it enough.\n\nI think it seems like people are more bothered because the post is near the top of the front page, so it's more visible and more people will comment on it. Usually these kinds of threads are controversial at best and heavily downvoted at worst.
Facebook stream works better then twitch for me\n\ne: Downvoted for saying what i've experienced with the stream.
the fuck are you on about? no one is guaranteed to be in the playoff only 6 teams go to the playoff
With Optic meeting Liquid in the next game I believe that's the end of their journey in Katowice. Still beating CoL must have been very satisfying.
"lightly mocking" lmao classic EU delusion 
Hahaha why are you NA boys who are usually the masters of memes so bitter and deeply infuriated about this joke?! Get off your high horse and stop taking this shit so serious.
Next update will be 1st March, maybe we have Seasonal Battle Pass (Spring)
The problem with NA teams is that they've imported so many EU players. They have to import players from other regions because Dota just isn't that popular in NA to have a really good player base to choose from but they needed to bring in players from the true strongest region for Dota which is the Middle East instead of EU.
They didn't fix the interaction between the new bounties and pudge's hook. Does it mean that there is actually a quest?
its working without facebook account tho. its good for me

Those twitch chat kids in every tournament spaming frogs and crying babies are angry because they don't get to spam them anymore.
What's this Telegram-bot-SirBelvedere-clan_iraq/GodlyKha meme about?
I don't see how it's not relevant if it's working. I collected sets with gems on some of my favourite heroes. Yes, they didn't create new gems with counters for a long time, but it's not the system that requires constant fixes.
Tinker's a whole other level of cancer from Invoker, only Techies is really on Tinker's level
just wear Sparrowhawk Set &amp; see what happens when u ult &amp; move compared to ult with other bows/sets.    \nshe just shoots arrows from her stomach &amp; no feet animation.

Yeah but you should be saving the tp for counter ganks and moving around more archon supports usually just afk in lane trying to deny creeps and leech exp.
Not really? After that 1v1 tourney they he won, he didn’t do anything noteworthy, the igV team sucked\n\nHe didn’t have good results until he joined VG and even then, the team was considered to be on a slump coming into this tournament 
Imagine being so low mmr that faking a carapace is impressive
So many getting offended by a simple wordplay joke :)
Not to take away from the fake, but regardless, MC would’ve turned around to avoid being omnislashed. That’s already a built in mind game with jugg.

fuck off, it's a fucking meme on internet. Get a grip you little sjw pussy. Suddenly saying feelsgunman is offensive because you murifats can't go 2 days without shooting up a school. How is that my problem? I should feel bad over a twitch meme on the internet? Arent you a sensitive little bitch.
Dude, he faked the fucking omnislash. Forcing MinD_ContRoL back into him. That was sick dude. That was actually sick. O huh huh huhh. That's so good, dude. What a fucking outplay. Holy shit, dude.
Who would have thought someone with unlimited resources would have a good head on their shoulders!
But you didn't save Pudge ?
Dude, I know you know the difference between have and of, as you've used both in your comment. Why not use the correct one all the time?\n\nBut that aside, from the time MC approaches the creepwave, any player would be compromised in that situation is what they are trying to say. Aside from a severe outplay by the nyx, that player dies. A "really good" player would not walk up to the creepwave, but then you can't say that play only works against really good players because MC walked up and his fate was kind of sealed.

Always save the animals
Felt like it could've been better. The Night Stalker wasting Hunter In The Night is pretty nice.
Some league of legends stuff here jumping after placing ward over wall XD
wew 1k scrub 15min 45 last hits with score 7-22
i mean even divine support players dont buy wards it happens everywhere\n\nnot that low divine is any good but still
maybe gabe's son will create hl3 within the next 10 years. #fingerscrossed
I do that and am divine[0] really not that good lol it's obvious to fake it... it's how you kill him
miracle is hands down better than every name your listed, im not even a fanboy, he is worse in the laning stage but his game sense/spell casting are both 10/10, the only other player which i would rank at the same level as him is rtz, ofc its not that big of a difference overall rtz and miracle are like 9.5/10 the other people are like 9/10(gh is a 10/10)
Against a bad player, lets be honest, if they omni knowing the enemy can walk back into creeps.
Don't ask too much dude, you got downvote already, let scrub be scrub.
but but but... laddas upp.....
What that I can outfarm a p1 in the offlane?  I’m never the guy to say my team sucks when I do bad.  Last game I played, my luna told my support to not stack for her so she can get the +15%.  Archon is not fun my guy.
Shhh now... Go with the circlejerk
Well I guess now we know who will inherit Steam and all of his wealth :(
Just look at all bugs in DotA2 (or any valve game), I don't think valve can release stuff faster than they currently are. \n\nEdit:\nIf anyone that downvoted think dota2 is bugfree, please read this https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=127919
Sure thing crusader boy , the enemies not being as smart as you is the reason you suck
The higher level you go, the more likely that support needs to buy the dust because the core's inventory is filled up with small item to maximize their power.\n\nYes, they will carry dust if the situation require it (or they are the one controlling the tempo), but most of the time it's the support's job to have it.\n\nOf course I will always carry dust as carry when I'm playing with my friend, reducing my farm efficiency and firepower because i know that they are just shit tier support.
not true full pos 5 Archon 5 here. but what ever u must be one of the archon wanna be carrys blaming everyone else while fucking up mid or farming
Not really that but the main reason they are at lower bracket is that they didn't recognize that if they want to climb, they need to be better and compensate what their teammate is shit at.\n\nDuring my climb I realize that the higher I go, the support will just have the dust such that the carry don't have to waste a slot on them. It's not really that only supports need to buy dust, but it's better to waste the slot on support most of the time (there are exceptions).
You should start learning on how to overcome your mistake. In every MMR there will be that teammate who blame you for nothing, even at divine.\n\nIgnore them and move on.\n\nAlso, learn to play more actively. Playing passive as support is fine if you want to remain at one MMR and learn the meta, but to win the game you need to take over the game.
dude is widely regarded as a top 5 mechanical player i dont know how underrated can he be. 
sweet play but u would be better of just letting them kill u there\n\n(or at least not blocking ur own camp for 6 minutes)
Good going Valve... 
Underrated comment
What? She’s ugly. Not a fan of gummy smiles
I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty upset that it took me like 10 rewatches to figure out that 'mind control' wasn't some sort new reworked rubick skill and actually the name of a player. 
Artifact was built on the graveyard of a completely different game, of a different genre and is the continuation of an already existing game series. R I P
What are you saying? That they should release millions of games? I dont understand 
Boring
Insecure Twitch troll coming through. "Euro dickrider" lmfao.  
So NA teams are NA only as long as they win?
OMEGALUL
he was confused. and thats impale :D
extraordinary if reliable
It wasnt manta dodge it was doppelganger dodge which is much easier to realize
Sad if banned :(
lmao europeans riled up by meaningless tournament, only reason you gotta chance is that we're playing with trash players. Eu hockey will never get remotely close to the level of na dont @ me
I feel like he was probably dead either way, but yeah it's a great play.
I simplified my explanation a bit, so the thing is if you "dont take damage" from spin you will take damage from right clicks. In most cases this is magic immunity but in the case of buildings spin doesnt deal damage (similar to shrapnel etc.), so you can damage it with right clicks. It can still be useful to use your right click through spin though, as it still procs mjollnir and stuff like that.
what friends?
It's ok . he has the ODPIXEL head shape if you faceswap them you would hardly spot the difference.
 &gt;twitch chat\n\nHow can a person who is not retarded enjoy twitch chat? \nBtw, that is correct spelling ---&gt; always. 
During your climb to crusader no? Because there is no way you dont have a slot for a TP and there is no way you are unable to switch dust / tp during the midgame if you're higher skilled then crusader.
u did lose xp and time by running around for half a minute(and by blocking the camp), u have no deso or lv12 to defend the tower(and no intetest in doing so either) and now u cant farm the camp for 6 mins which is tons of gold
Depends on who pegs
fuck off 
&gt;Yes, they will carry dust if the situation require it (or they are the one controlling the tempo)\n\nI stated there, there are situations where core is required to carry dust especially when they need to initiate, because there's no way for support to go in and dust at the right timing. But most of the time you don't want dust on a farming core, if anything, it indicate the support is doing something wrong.
Humungous if precise
We're missing our 250 best players while you don't even have 40 players in the nhl, quite a difference. Doesn't really matter though, fact is that nobody gives a flying about the olympics here, we're not even watching it. It's a meaningless tournament with meaningless players, boring.
We must cure the cancer. Ps: fuck sea servers!!?????
Or just... adjust your build that game. I always buy urn on Phoenix, but if there's a Pudge or an Earth Spirit I'll let them get it since it will get more mileage. 
Please make Dota retard proof. Only those over IQ of 9000 be allowed to play dota
Admiral Bulldog if authentic
thats not true, i have actually tried that within the last year
Or how about you just communicate with your teammates and adjust your build accordingly?
What?
Traps are NOT gay and I am here to prove it. Let's start with logic thinking. We will apply these questions to a trap, and it will help determine if they are gay. Does the person have a masculine penis? No, they have a feminine penis. Is the person a man? No, they are called dickgirls for a reason. Does a man have a numerical value of 1? No, not only is that not the case, but a man (or a woman) has no numerical value. This is nonsense. Is it gay to be fucked by a girl? No, if this was the case then all heterosexual sex would in fact be homosexual in nature. Suffice to say, I think we can all agree that traps are not gay using quick and easy logic thinking. Now, we will use imagination thinking to imagine a situation in which you are having sexual intercourse with a trap. Ok, so like imagine this chick; but she's this totally fucking SMOKING hot chick, and she's got really sexy titties and a sexy butthole that you can pound and a sexy little feminine penis you can stroke and suck. Did that feel gay? I thought not. We have used both of the types of thinking to solve the mystery of if traps are gay. They are not. I have used indisputable science techniques to skip the hypothesis completely and go straight to a proof. Science thinking is a secret third type of thinking that many people don't have so this may be a difficult concept to grasp for some. I am happy to explain my theorem further and am opening this thread to discussion.
"Yes, I don't mind." is what he probably meant. 
Thanks for explaining the obvious. (:
But is science thinking gay?
Permaban if genuine

hm, if they're getting all the charges, have you considered that you might be the gameruiner and that you shouldve just let them buy the urn in the first place?
you have a completed spirit vessel before your teammate buys an urn? I think you have other issues here m8
That's a double negative. So he indeed is a Shadow Friend?
nah \nretarded 2k teammate: +50 damages
He's not wrong about the social experiment part if you take a look at the punishment system Valve put in the game. Anyway, it IS true that you can't criticize people, and I'm not talking about flaming them. Like you really can't even suggest anything because the majority will actually be butthurt if you try. I don't know why do people think you're trying to teach them how to play or something.
Well, NA hockey has won every gold medal in the last 2 Olympics. And all but one silver medals... I'd say EU hockey LUL
didn't Burning and some other player both buy Vlads in some TI match\n\nif people at TI do retarded shit then anything can work
Fucking right!
traps are a little gay
True af
Yes, but it's a lot slower than the other 2 if you're able to juke into trees or something
O hai there, my comment is mentioned here i see. Feel free to check out a game after which i wrote that one. https://www.opendota.com/matches/3744758289\nIm disruptor if anyone wonders.\n
Just as people flame for 2 Shivas, when the main use of Shivas is not even affected by how many you have.
Idk i just saw a stream clip on YouTube. Maybe his fans reported him and eventually he received a ban.
All flaming is feedback. Players who find themselves constantly flamed utterly deserves it as it is something wrong with their playstyle.\n\nProblem is, you can't easily flame people without lowering your behavior score - which is silly, as you can still: flame over VOIP or creative insults without touching a single 'foul word.'\n\n\nThe Valve stance of punishing any non-excessive flaming is just retarded (soon as you mention one foul word), because you are not dealing with the problem.       \nNotably, an account buyer will just buy a new account if no one says or reacts to anything once his done with it - the same way people will continue to make bad play if thee is no feedback.        \n*On a side note: being friendly suggestive is counter-productive as it usually brings up a counter-reply than actual flaming-feedback.*\n\n***\n\nFinally, ignoring (as the go to online-authority solution is) is not what we do as humans in real-life as anyone on the internet can come back with a new face/ alias so it is every ineffective. \n\n\n\nIn real life if you behave poorly in eg. a pub, you get thrown out and shut-out, and never show your face again, not just ignored.\n\n\nNon excessive flaming is more useful than people think.
why are you getting downvoted lul it's actually true
You'll need that little stun in teamfights more than you need the golem. In case you got ganked up, you have no way to react while Exorcism and Serpent wards last for a duration, you can still use those to fight.
Hence my use of quite. In the vast majority my point stands. 
He's kinda right actually.
&gt;I know it is based on proximity\n\nIsn't it actually based on who has more charges left? Like both are close enough to the kill then the one with more charges gets another?
Wasted 100 gold + blocked creep camp. Not sure if it is a win 
&gt; You don't like it? Abandon.
No.
If your definition of a worse player is a player that'll perform better than you in the majority of matches but once in a while have a meltdown and singlehandedly lose the game then I guess you're right. I'd say he's a better player but a worse teamplayer but who really cares what we call them anyways
he's right tho
I sold all my collection since 2013 couple month ago. So i don't mind any. Ignore any shit and lazy people . Be rich in real life. Some poor want their desire to be full fill but they never work on their laziness. Want be rich? Ignore lazy and shit mind people in real life and gaming. I don't mind toxic player but hardworking and understanding basic. Same apply in real life. Picking support role early game you watch your core/carry play really bad ( watch how they apply basic thing ) , stop support them and trust stable and average core player. If none, start making your item from the start. I sound rude not donating single cent to poor people in real life. Ask yourself why. Some of them tend to stay shit and lazy while people pouring them money. Same apply in dota2 ranked. I hope lazy and shit people stay dreaming being rich until they dead. Ameen\n\nStill think DotA2 just A GAME?
unrelated
It's not Gabe Newell's son. They just used it as clickbait.
When rubick's chronos are better than the void's
pathetic ass event 
Haha 25 mins and game one is over. Game two might be even faster if Navi keeps drafting like this.
Tell your team your making an urn? Kinda pointless to have 2 for this exact reason
This game showcased something about NaVi that I never understood. When you give Crystallize void, and you're grouping up for a chrono, shouldn't you at least be all on the one hero you want to eliminate? Every time he casts chrono, there's always this 1st second wasted because he switches targets. Not to mention he fucked up hard with not casting time dilation as fast. Really nice steals from Faith tho!
Ironically this is literally their best strat. Void+Sky+QoP. Apparently works only agains tier4 in CIS quals.
Na'Vi so shit. \n\nBM gets caught in front of base, dies, NB pushes rax.\n\nNa'Vi decision making be like : Should we bb this pos 3 hero and deter NB from pushing or at least take a 5v5 fight ? \n\nNah, save that super important bb and give away rax then start a fight anyway without BM in position.
To promote communication 
I separate flaming from excessive-pointless-mentally-unstable flaming.\n\nAll flaming that is related to game-play is feedback regardless on how you try to bend it.\n\n\nNaturally, soft-shelled people like you who can't handle real-life cruelty gets drawn to the internet, but it also brings out the worst of people behind anonymity.\n\nDota is game meant for entertainment, not some reality-escape where people like you can believe playing poorly in a team-based game game (particularly ranked) without repercussions is okay.
Navi is so dissapointing, god they are back to dumpster.
Ok mr pro see you at TI then 
It worked like op said some years ago, but was nerfed/buffed (depending on who you ask) so the smoke trick shouldn't be working.
This part is 100% truth:\n"Honestly, this game is turning into some pma simulator where your rank goes up if you can coexist with retards rather than if you actually know how to play dota."\n\nDota is supposed to be about playing to win, but instead its become about making other people happy, even if its to the detriment of your chances of winning the game.\n
My mmr is around 1-2k. My overall conduct is bad and no I'm not toxic. After being matched with toxic players every single game i have no intentions of playing this game nor trying to carry my team for whole 50 minutes and right clicking on creeps just to not get disconnected. Valve system is broken, community is biggest problem but Valve is reason why these toxic players are not banned already. Saying that he is probably bad because he could't carry team of 4 moron feeders is not only stupid but makes you look like you are toxic too since you defend these toxic feeders. \n\nToday I got matched 4 matches in a row with mid or feed and I just quit because I'm not no lifer to stay 40 minutes waiting for match to finish I'd rather do something useful. Currently in low priorirty again coz of abandons and I have no intensions of playing Dota again no metter how much game is FREAKING AWESOME the community and system is terrible and makes me never open game again. \n\nGood job Valve, in 2015 there was over 800,000 players now there is around 500,000 on average. U officially killed over 300,000 player base and u keep going
buy wards\n\nwaaards
Yeah exactly, nothing amazing about the clip, standard good jugg play, do this all the time. BSJ's reaction is probably the best part.
Dosn't change that it was actually General and Crystallize being catastrophic, and I'm not even exaggerating - they were horrendous. I don't think we'll get to see a good Na'vi soon.
Weaver onto Rubick DK SK? Plz sonneiko comeback
also the pma simulator and the retards should be flamed part
No problem :)\n\nBonus fun fact - Chronosphere is the only true-sight providing spell that will reveal smoked units.
General seems angry with the draft.
So shameful if you have to sell it because you realize he bought it first and you didn't pay attention.
You're not wrong. I just responded to the guy who called his toxic teammates for worse players which they aren't
if ure smth like luna u can easily outrun the green panda after he stoned u\n\n\nstill not very useful though
Why is the Englihs main cast only on Facebook? Is this just an ESL thing?
classic reddit retards. the hate for NaVi is fucking real. every comment i read is about them being trash. sick. lets just ignore the fact that the roster just formed like 10 days ago and they had bootcamped for 5 days. and its their first lan with new players. and its fucking NEWBEE. Newbee. new fucking bee. just keep that in mind before you continue to start typing that they are back to the dumpster and shit like that lmfao 
^Wait what does that even mean? My point still stands and I made an point unlike you calling people toxic over internet. I'm not going to argue with people like you because I feel you are exactly the toxic kid in my team who feeds 24/7 of his games because u didn't get to play mid
1: if it's a wave vs wave situation, the enemy creeps will attack you for 2 seconds before they re-aggro your creeps again because you cannot attack them all in that time\n\n2:  it's much more comfortable to use call; it's a low attention play, allowing you to focus on more important things. call has low cd and low mp cost\n\n3: i know there are people who don't know you can aggro creeps that way, but defining using call as the wrong play is ignorant. it in itself is a good tip\n
Try sumiya invo build
Lmao what is general doing , he has 10 second to use anything but he give away the split.\n\nNavi looks a bit lose to me tbh
Navi playing vs Rubick first time this series. Why would thet pick weaver carry on those heroes seriously. 
&gt; Calling someone a retard is not criticism. It's flaming and DOES NOTHING POSITIVE to help any situation\n\nThats right. Though i didnt say its okay to call someone a retard. Maybe i really should clarify myself. I said the OP is right to an extent. People tend to feel offended way too often. Its due to the nature of the game. Critical situations need to be handled in a very short time. What i mein is that even the best formulated "criticism" is sometimes missinterpreted by some people. 
I think you can't cast chrono in a way that wouldn't reveal smoke just from hero proximity. Smoke has a 1025 popping range and void has 600 casting range on the chrono, plus 425 chrono's radius (1025 total as well). So unless you build the lens, you'd always cast your chrono from the same range the smoke pops or closer. Although you're probably right that smoke would still be dispelled by chrono. 
it seems like na'vi players haven't seen a rubick yet in their lives 
No thanks. 
General is so bad, it's actually funny.
There is when it comes to Valve's current state. I mean he even said as much by saying that their "working machine" environment is what's keeping them "safe". And said they should work toward pushing something out.\n\nIf Valve was in a position where they actually needed money. You can bet something would have been put out by now. Their revenue stream seems to have become a crutch. 
Ok, just report brew he is throwing.
giving up EVERY teamfight ulti to a rubick surely is caused by the team being new. sure, buddy.
yeah I agree too. But come on man the way general plays sometimes is so shitty. 
Dude, get your head from your ass - it's General and Crystallize sucking - they have been on the team for a long time - I can understand they need to figure out their decisionmaking - but losing the game to a fucking pos 5 Rubick is just bad - B.A.D.
Why would new fuck a bee? You are disgusting
They did, but that series was pretty close, so it makes no sense even from that perspective.
Yes, they get internet moneys, we get a terrible streaming platform.
Crystallize really making it easy for faith
i get that. bad day or smth. 
yeup
Kudos to you, good sir. PA players are the best.
Not a very probable scenario, is it
Nah, that's just a broken english slang phrase used a lot by afroamericans.
Navi is back! .....
U guys need to stop sucking his dick 
Dendi ruining game so much
DPC points for what
Na'Vi still not top tier?
stfu fangay
direct invite and can't even win one game. smh such a waste. should've given that spot to another region.
You need to stop using a phone from the 90's. 
Navi is back....\n\nTo the dumpster
To the dumpster
cant spell trash withou navi
Lebron left Cavs for this\nAlso Navi.Lul
ure assuming games are won and lost after a single action which isnt true\n\nif ure acting like a jackass u dont just magically get taxed some mmr once per month while being a completely normal player the rest of ur games\n\nif once per game one dude razes the camp his teamate was farming and the other doesnt, the other guy will probably not go and feed, but it(as well as his other shenanigans) will add up on a large enough amount of gamea
Dark horse of tournament LuL
They need to remove that "Vodafone PRESENTS Post-match"
DK and TB have to go. This is not okay
1st game 25 Minutes, 2nd Game 33 Minutes. If Na'Vi played BO5 maybe Game 3 could end in 40 minute and still lose anyway.\n\nSo that's that for Na'Vi ESL Major run. No Circuit Points, small sum of prizepool, and Embarassment to take home.
Lil is just pathetic af. If you look at his insta stories it's just him watching the VP games alone. 
dead team
Is okay bois direct invitefor TI8 secured TY lil
I miss my tnc
New Team excuses aside, how can someone suck at generally basic game mechanics[Taking advantage of hero timings,tracking rosh,etc etc] so hard despite playing it professionally 24/7 for years, Baffling sad stuff
go fuck yourself you degenerate asshole classic reddit braindead animal
say it once more for the retards on this thread. 
are you retarded? if a lvl 6 jugg run towards you any player would go into creeps. this is literally the most basic shit ive ever seen. Tired of herald redditors talking
perfect showing of the team that have +900 dpc point and epicenter major direct invite without accomplishment
i mean he had the best possible team in cis region.and according to every1 in the team he threw it away coz he cudnt change his playstle and was lazy.still he came out as a cocky kid after swap pretending he was right.HE said time will show.well it has shown
They haven't won even a single game.
Get a fucking backbone you pansy, if we followed your guidelines this sub would be fucking dead.\n\nAnd like it or not this kind of shit talking comes with any game become large, you don't like this then I hope you're okay with shit tier tournaments with pizza for a prize.\n
sonneiko was the key...they need a captain but now due to roaster lock...can't change the team...IDK why they picked lebron when they desperately want a captain after sonneiko departs
And you, a herald 1 player apparently
direct invite to epicenter btw
my comment has nothing to do with anything you mentioned. i feel bad for lil because i think he played so well in the two games but the rest of navi are just absolute dogshit.
Pretty sure I've read this before. Over and over
do you honestly see their performance getting better??
Stop fooling yourselves guys.       \nNavi is not back they never were.      \nThey are just inconsistent tier 3 fan favorite team. Thats all.      \n
Dude is right though, whenever i'm flaming an obvious misplay by a dude he should just take it and stop whining. Or mute me and play on. But what does this generation of gamers do? Go ruin a game because they are easily triggered man children (or actual children). I usually laugh at these kinds of player. Sure my game is ruined but they have a bigger chance to get lp. It's so funny how easily triggered people are nowadays. I grew up on being called the most cancerous shit and i usually laughed at their stupid faces, it's just the internet, grow up. 
what, how do you do this?
Salty fangay LUL new roster LUL\nJust can't accept the fact that navi can only deal with tier 2 or 3 teams
1. Void has a Chrono radius talent as well ;) and you can make Aether Lens as you mentioned.\n\n2. It's a smoke trivia, very rarely you'll any of this actually happening. But it would reveal smoked heroes.
&gt; Note that if you swap out Arcanes you obviously will be slower. \n\nDisassemble - swap EB to backpack - unlock EB - unlock boots when you want the arcanes again
Everyone knows that Jugg *trick*.  \n  \n&gt;when he pops ulti, use your smoke  \n  \n&gt;&gt;3 very confused pandas hitting a creep wave  \n  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Note this one works only if the earth panda is not within smoke break range  \n  \nWhat's the point?  \n  \nLycan just ulti and run. No way a TB can def every lane lycan pushes.\n  \n
You what to know what is really sad? People still use Twitlonger in 2018. SMH
Anyone else smell some bullshit here?
Is there a reason why? It seems people who are not familiar with the term might pronounce it ES-PORTS (not that English isn't full of strange pronunciations already). Stylistically I prefer e-sports, but that's just my opinion.
Well, losing half of your investment hurts a lot and just feels bad, but yea, ive been there and its quite tilting.
Yeah I just looked into it, Canada doesn't seem to be sending their NHL players. 
I mean....this is a valid question (minus the "too"), many people use the "I will purchase X item" to state the need of that item to be purchased and not that they want to purchase that item.
Is this mage-s team? Feel sorry for him, mage is a beast and I'm simply waiting for him to get on a stable team so he can show off his skill.
By following along with your teams bad decisions (taking stupid fights, going up highground way too early, trying to rosh when its for sure going to end in disaster etc. etc.) instead of making better plays. When your team makes stupid plays, you have to go along with it and lose yourself the game or get reported.\n\nYou know who REALLY deserves to be reported? Players who tilt because their allies are doing something they don't agree with. THAT should be a punishable offence.
but how to do it? I just tried it and nothing happened.
its sad people cant get your point, projecting their bitchiness on you.
There's a flaw in your 'logic'. You say that the other player will be 'at least on your level or perhaps even better'. So, if it's possible for others to be better than you, then it should also be possible that you are better than them. \n\nYou say they'll always be at least on your level, but that contradicts your assertion that people can be better than others...
Share please, didn't come off as toxic to me whenever I got matched up with or against him in ranked 
i honestly don't understand what you're saying. they already hit my creeps. then i a-click an enemy hero to take aggro, but if i don't hit them they don't stick on me, they de-aggro again
He absolutely did not say anything about being the best. That's false argument. His points are focused on the fact, that people are negatively reacting to criticism. If I ask in game for something simple, like the infamous  ward mid, and I wont get it (i dont play mid, but i kinda understand them), i would hell call the support out. 
Purposely type in all chat "coming top" as a roamer but ur really going mid or bot for a cheeky gank
people buying urn in pubs under 6k? i call bullshit
Hmm well I wouldn't put it past him, as more or less every player gets toxic from time to time in pubs I guess. Time will tell I guess, to me he didn't stand out more than anyone else in that regard 
Still works for the other creep heroes (spirit bear, familiars, golems &amp; astral spirit).
Dude. You're just wrong. There's nothing about this that is correct.
Also by attacking allies I think?
You think wrong
No I really meant it. Did u copy pasted that comment from anywhere? Am I feeling a deja vu here? I legit felt like I've read those exact comments here
promocode:
Than you get flamed cause you missed the afk guy
But there are in fact a LOT of People nowadays, that cant take any criticism and call it flaming. in some situations u have to use your mic and tell your teammate loud and clearly that he has to do sth so he understands how important it is. oh dear, I got muted so many times &lt;3 
haha, wtf, this might be the worse tips ever.\n\n1) they do\n\n\n2) yeeeh, it doesn't work like that buddy, check your mechanics\n\n3) and what do you do if lycan decides to splitpush?
If you got completely shit on during laning phase, you might find yourself in this kind of trouble, not that unlikely, if you ask me\n
i mean my original comment to which you replied was about lil not na'vi specifically.should re read that.yeah navi can get better but lets be real they can't become sum1 to compete with liquid secret with this roster.
because...?
&gt;SEA is not an easy region, it has probably the second hardest qualifiers after china.\n\nAll that really matters is if you can beat the best team in the qualifier. Rather face TNC or OG?\n\nBut Black is just one of those players that should probably have retired already.
your faith on people actually using features right is amusing.
In their minds, they absolutely *are* the best player on the team.  My last match (ID: 3744406685), our Abbadon was given safelane solo.  He died three times before anything else happened.  I'm holding mid, and while comm banned (and I swear to fuck, this only happens when I get a straight run of nothing but Peruvians who can't understand me andsimply stop talking) I'm calling my missings properly.  SB is charging left and right, he's caught out of position four or five times, killed twice by the charge.  "WHY IS NO ONE CALLING FUCKING SB MISSING?!"  And we are.  I'm calling SF missing, though SF was pretty decent.\n\nIt's about 35 minutes of listening to Abba tell us that we were trash, supports should follow the carry (they were following me, because I was the one doing the work as Leshrac).  To him, though, Axe wasn't landing calls (he wasn't, to be fair),. I wasn't pushing towers (because I'm tryign to save his sorry ass more than I can push), WD and Lion are stealing his kills (yes, that WD is totally stealing your kills with Maledict).  Then he starts telling Lion, who is in his stack, "Your MMR clearly hasn't calibrated since we're playing with terrible players."  We were losing.\n\nThe enemy BB ends up abandoning.  Abba leaves soon after once he told us all to uninstall and kill ourselves.  And after he left?  We fucking won.  His teammate didn't leave the game with him.  Hell, we *all* reported him for feeding, and I got my report back, so...yay!\n\nAnd because I'm *fair* in my criticism of shitters like this, the guy is American.
Sick invoker winrate.
That's not relevant to my comment. It might be a team game but its called solo queue. Every player should have the right to approach the game as they wish (provided they aren't doing anything to ruin the game). If you adopt a lone wolf approach (pun intended), YOUR MMR WILL REFLECT THAT, you shouldn't also be punished for it by the report system.\n\nThe real cancer in dota is know-it-all players who think because they follow comp dota they are experts on dota strategy and meta, and then proceed to give up at min 1 because somebody adopted a strategy they think is bad. They then play badly and blame the loss on the non-conformist player, even if he ends up playing the best on the team. \n
toxic player are way better than people at their mmr. I was mid 5k in my solo rank, but was 3.8 k at seasonal rank (idc about that mmr so i go 1v9 toxic idgaf mode)
Just USA tho, Canada has been reking face.
rofl so entitled
I saw a CM rushing Heart of Tarrasque, no boots, no wards, no courrier. Didn't tell anyone until 20min in that she's going 'core'. Yeah it's not like she's the most bambi-esque, don't hurt me, fragile hero there ever was. Oh wait! She is!\n\nOk, I guess there's wisp.
there's more to it than "their players are better" \n\nDid you say newbee players are worse than navi players after they beat them in dreamleague? 
If you pick Timber into a bad lane or a game with  counters at no point will you ever be effective no matter your farm.  Broods is situational not greedy people need to know the difference cause that’s what Timber is this patch\n\nEdit: wrong comment chain lmao thought you were from a different thread where I discussing if Timber was example of a super greedy or just situational offlaber, was on mobile so didn’t check properly 
Not really, because you're watching the creep wave's movement from base. Your comment mostly only applies when a creep wave is pushing past your t2, at which point your creeps won't move far enough to give you useful information.
Seriously what even is this secret draft.\n\nCore SB. We're in a golden age of dynamic meta. I don't even care of it works, it's just fun to watch them try.
If anything, this post proves that toxic players are hopeless
LGD is still not a top tier?
It really hurts to see how this guy is actually so close to epiphany, but then still misses the point in the end.
I care because muting my allies generally means less possible coordination. I still do it but I like when I'm able to have an ally that will constructively communicate with me rather than continuously flame. \n\nEDIT: it's also just annoying. I play the game to have fun and challenge myself. It's more fun and rewarding when I have allies that are pleasant and fun. Plus we also generally will communicate better and have better plays. Having an ally that constantly flames and complains about every little thing isn't enjoyable. 
What the fuck was that from Puppey lol
Master puppan being cocky again. Whats new
Lul secret 
I member
I did not claim you need to write an essay. That is you attacking a strawman.  \n\n"gyro no bkb ffs" makes it likelier this person will mute you ("okay this guy is raging and i don't need the negativity), not consider your viewpoint as neutral ("I thought about that, but really, what could THAT guy know?") or just try to spite you ("It's a good idea, but we won't win this game anyway and I don't want to give him the satisfaction") \n\nHow about this instead? \n\n"gyro, what are you building?" \n\n"boots rapier" \n\n"maybe get bkb first? they have shittons of stuns, they'll lock you down hard" \n\nThat's it. \nVery slightly longer, I grant you that, but much less likely to be considered to be a know-it-all trying to put you down. This obviously isn't gonna make it MUCH more likely that people will listen to you (although it's not exactly uncommon that i'm the only person on the team that the 0/10/2 SF will even bother to not mute), but it'll cut down a lot on any hostility or reports you encounter. \n

Just as in real life, sometimes they listen and if you have good arguments, they will do it. Sometimes they dont.\n\nWhat is important is how you say it :\n\n&gt; GG WP\n&gt; GG WP\n&gt; Why dont you have a bkb ?????????\n\n100% chance the guy will mute you and ignore you.\n\n&gt; I think you should get a bkb\n&gt; You are getting controled a lot in the fights\n\n100% chance the guy won't mute you and a fair chance he will actually get a bkb.\n

You are literally the definition of a man child. This is the type of thing a bully under the age of 12 would say about his class mates that he just bullied. After 12 they usually mature a little.
But according to Reddit, LGD is the only team that could fulfill the prophecy of winning the international this year.\n\n...What a joke team.
also acc to Reddit, LGD is better than VG
According to Reddit, EG is a top tier team and Sumail is mature! 
Please explain to this guy what a meme is
lgd weak link is really their offlaner i've watched their games at last shitladder against liquid,he fucked up big time just like this game
I am pretty sure no one has said that and you are just projecting but sure. Whatever you choose to believe Reddit says I guess.
you're fucking retarded mate
Lol Fy captaining lmaoooo
lol what? he did a fucking ton of things when given good matchup like 10 min of 2nd game. It's Fy the fucking idiot shotcaller here.
There is just no way Mineski can win this. DK can never comeback in a game. And DP is too weak in late game. They are way too far behind OG at this point.\n\nSad to see them out of the tournament so early.\n\nEdit: Lol I posted this after the game is over to mock all the people who were saying Mineski can't win. Now people are downvoting me seriously??
wut?
Lol 3k 
Blitz always sucks Reso's dick. He loves to hype Reso like he's some sort of God or something. But Reso just had his timing back at TI- because EG was on the brink of collapse that time. The guy was mediocre or below average before that when he was DC after their Genting win. He's getting exposed. 
Lol this is all Reso lmao, such a low impact SF with that networth and the epic throw at toplane

I don't know what the fuck Reso is doing. Yesterday all OG team gave Resolution all the farm he needed but went yolo alone and died. He is exactly doing the same thing today... 
You are getting downvoted because you make the same shit comments 20 times. Just chill dude.
I hope they lose, I've spent too much energy supporting them and they just keep losing their own games. Hope they start playing again with the next iteration, but I won't get triggered by this shit any more. 
And you failed.
They didnt have silence. Why the fuck they didnt have silence. Shit items, dagon is a waste of money. 
You fucked up the ice shards though. Could have been a Dazzle kill, if the hero had no TP scroll.
Good old ESL dicksuckers on reddit. I swear some of these guys are getting paid
It's not about being wrong or right. It's about being fucking annoying. But no problem sir, i will downvote you with pleasure. Have a nice day.
He seriously talks so much shit ,its hard to listen to.

Hey dude just letting you know me and my discord server used to check your comment history every couple of weeks because everything you posted was grade A hilarity in very much the same manner as the OP post here\n\neven mentioning the name 'noobman5k' is honestly a legendary in-joke to us
Everyone's favorite casting duo? Are you high?
ingame audio is terrible (it is cutting every time) and the fb stream is buffering each 15 seconds and need to reload.. thanks esl..
There was no real danger tho. Neat play but didn't change anything.
Next update this troll net will not pierce though bkb anymore xd
Tbf Enigma is getting a lot of damage from the death ward already and no one can follow up the BH...
bigdick_gaben knew it.
Didn't make any difference, honestly.\n1 second left on BH would have change nothing
Well, troll is almost as good as alpha wolf (depending on lineup), and if you need bkb piercing disable it is really a no-brainer. 
The ult was almost 2/3rd's finished by the time he was netted as well.
"god plays" lol europeans are so insufferable
Yeah, i watched twitch for a while because they say facebook is lagging and shit and boycott and stuff but the casting is too bad. Watched at facebook and its flawless, 1080p with no stutters at all.
Yeah, pressed q.
I thought that too, but DK attacks like 3 times after the black hole gets interrupted and then pops cheese. The Black hole would have ended before he died.
and he took almost 4 seconds to cancel it with his creep at the side of enigma, what a god.
Amazing play, great foresight and understanding of the game by Notail. If the game was closer it absolutely could have changed the game.
It could have been also someone else if he shared units, right?
Upvoted for Always Sunny reference
LOL
Haha I get it it's funny because you tried to find a screenshot where as many heroes as possible are stacked on top of each other so it looks confusing to new players hah that's funny.
Dunno why you're getting downvoted when that is the reality, especially when there was no follow up whatsoever within 1 second of the black hole
OG fanstraights SoBayed ?
little known fact, troll net will cancel pango's ult and net him. 1900 gold item counters an entire hero.
Hey 6.81 called, they want their screen cap back
You know what would be funny, if he like, if he like, like occasionally just lazily moved the mouse and threw that net like it was nothing!!!\n\n\nHa ha\n\nHa ha ha\n\n\nHaha ah ahahahahaahahah!!!....
Why did I read that in pewdiepie's voice?
BERRY SMART
I miss team DK :(
when he blinked into the pit with bkb and guardian angel? Literally unable to be killed that's the opposite of reckless. 
he enfeebled the SF. CCNC didn't seem to notice... blinked in, right clicked for 4 damage and the missed his mid-raze. Pretty embarrassing display.
hahaah I didn't catch that, classic. Berry optimistic. 
Yesbrain PogChamp
Really hope Tobi will cast whole finals day. \n\nI'll be there live and hope my day won't get ruined by deadpan Blitz casts
tbf Ophelia's creeps got Movement speed buff like +40. Chen's creeps would be a bit slow unlike HotD's one.
The potential for AI improvements with Dota2 is infinite.
Legend tells of a triple-tag title, but few—if any—have ever actually seen it.
A flower who has trouble growing facial hair apparently. 
For some reason, I thought you were referencing "Llamas with Hats."
Heroes of the storm is a good dota tutorial \n
TBH it's pretty stupid that this exists. You can't do anything to play against it. Linken+bkb+blink just so you can ult against a team that has a simple stun and an hotd.
I don't think it was relevant, it was casted for almost the entire duration and it still did nothing
That though tbh is a very common thing people say.  Like Tobis prob my fav caster but thats just common saying of a lot of casters.
They're only visible for spectators.
I'm aware of the jungle changes in the games current state, but I mean back then when Chen and Enigma were more regular picks.
Yes they were picked, but from what I saw they were just reduced to bitch supports and had pathetic networths most of the time whereas in HoN it was widely known that they were among the fastest early game farmers which translated to fast Meks, Blinks, Pipes and battle items in general.\n\nI know it's unviable now due to obvious jungle nerfs, but that wasn't the case a long time ago.
Seriously, even Rawdota has acquired OpenAI. How is it that a poop level caster, not even a pro player, gets to use OpenAI?
I mean, it's kinda easier to use that term instead of explaining what is an Ancient, in that way.\n\nCongrats on your free karma btw
the blinding light is cool and all but i swear to god the kotl blast is in the air the moment both bk and repel run out
Huh i guess this obvious play even people in 3k bracket wont find impressive completely discards years of of being utter trash in every team hes in
Brood was Enfeebled before BKB and just had no damage to kill Bane. Reflection and Incapacitating Bite both do not pierce BKB.\n\nHow is this shit getting upvoted.
2 very different games and metas, even though they tried very hard to keep it 1:1, the cast times in hon made a lot of things way better than they were in dota. Like the early days of magnus(sand king) stunning longer than he took to channel his ult, so that you litterally could not interrupt his channel if he landed the stun on you. 
Did you win this game?\n\nYou fucked up there if you ask me.\n\nyou should've stayed and helped PL end it in my opinion.\n\nPL has cheese and on top of that you have greaves and crimson guard ready. could have easily killed all of them knowing you're leading in NW and kills.\n\njust an opinion reddit please no bashing.
There's already Starcraft tournaments where people try to program the best AI to beat out other AI's. It's a whole AI tournament, and if you understand Starcraft it's insane to watch it being played at 99% efficiency. Shit would roll any human player, instantly.
That's what I'm saying, they removed all magic immunity from ancients if that even mattered, I think you can kick these golems too. 
yeah, the missiles didn't really matter a lot because they were lvl 2, it wasn't enough. Still, you can't just say that on a reddit post, you have to say "omg such a good play"
That isn't true. It's 2sec and 2.17 stun in hon same as dota. In both heroes have 25% innate status resistance. People in HoN just commonky knew the tactic to stun into someone's back so they have to turn around to stop your channel.     \n\nMagnus was one of the most OP heroes in early HoN, but not for the reason you gave
well played sir! i tip my hat to you for not giving up
not true at all, the fastest stun in the game was pharoah(clockwork) you could stun into him with magmus and stand right next to him with no other targets arround, and he still could not cancel magmus channel. 
What if OpenAi is a representative team from Gaben to secure his major prize? thinking:
HoN sounds like dota.
Streamable has ads on mobile
Nice fake title, no tiny
That's actually my boy Jamal. He's kewl.
wow dude so fucking good!!! he clearly jacked it before this game
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7lny4w/steven_adams_playing_some_dota_2/
They wanted to keep the AI to a local moderated source . Since it's self learning capabilities are high they won't be sure if any subset rules are broken and then it goes out of Dota framework 
 EU DOTA LUL
LOL his screen is so small
remind me to remember you in 5 seconds
Literally who? Why do you people worship these irrelevant no names and their drama? Cringe af, delete.
He is in about the same spot he was at TI4 and he got slaughtered by icefrog afterwards.
ppd need better squad.
if a tier 1 player play that sf bane will be death.
Lina sounds like a decent counter to Tinker. She doesn't rely on attacks as much and can burst him down. Her only problem is she's slow and squishy. 
It's just internet points that don't mean anything amigo, I'll live. The tards who post and follow this crap content though, bet their parents regret not aborting.
I dont think mmr means anything anymore. I just ranked up to ancient 0 from legend 5 with lower mmr than when i was calibrated. I think rime is good enough to gain mmr without stream snipe one of his friend.
No, actually I got banned on a sub I frequent and they have a 1 day requirement before new accounts can post, so I made this yesterday and just started using it. I literally cannot give less of a shit about karma.
no it isnt 
if lina kept running towards the tower after getting hit by the rockets, tinker would've probably dived to get the kill, which means he would've tanked many tower hits. Additionally, Lina could've performed another Iron branch play, being out of vision from tinker so he can't right click her and the tower still hits him. Otherwise she could've just ran behind the trees, thus juking him, but that wouldn't have worked unless she had a Faierie Fire, I think...
Yeah they want more of gorg and rime posts whoever they are xd\n\nBlurry screenshots of these people being 12 year olds and threatening to unfriend the other is the quality content this sub really needs. Woe be to anyone who speaks out against your autism.\n\n
top 40 in what?
Heard of him, I know he's irrelevant. Don't know the other. That's not an insult to either but I'm fairly sure they wouldn't want this shitty content on the front page either at least they shouldn't if they don't have brain damage.
you completely missed the play lol\n\nlina plants a gg branch right before tinker casts heat seeking missile, and the branch causes tinker to lose vision of lina causing the missiles to do nothing 
If only I could be so grossly incandescent...
 Couldn’t he try kicking an ancient away?
ez ? bm
To be honest I've never been a fan of shoutcasting. I much prefer people analyzing play. I do agree that there should be someone there for the play-by-play, but idk Tobi just rubs me the wrong way. At least he's not Aysee though, so it could be worse. But stuff like "This has never been done before in the history of dota" and random screaming isn't what makes me like dota. Seems more appropriate for a Brazilian soccer cast rather than a high complexity e-sport. That and I've never been impressed by Tobi's game knowledge... is he even ranked? To be fair I haven't followed the competitive scene for a few years so he could have improved, but it seems like the Tobi I knew before, not terrible, but an excuse I would use to stop watching a streamed game (it would take a lot for me to watch a whole game nowadays mind you). 
Up
So, exactly what you should have done after reading my post?
I can take that.
what the fuck is team horde, what did they win and why are you telling me like it's supposed to mean something?
i ne'd
He really really really isn't. Only an idiot would say what you just said. I could link you my Tinker games from around that time, I am 30-0 or even 40-0 in most of them. All one did was stack ancients until Ethereal + Dagon 5 and then insta win the game. Tinker right now is very beatable.  \n\nedit: https://imgur.com/a/mui6N here you go, okay only one was 40+ kills but still.
tbh they would have won even with full duration black hole. Making a play when u are already so far ahead nothing special
You cant just suddenly redefine what snipe means. That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works.
J DOG LUL
that stopped happening regularly pretty recently anyway, like what, 2014/2015? then he was just an average jungler after that
A Tinker getting cucked is always satisfying, thanks for the gif my man!
\n* Whoops
He's watching (sniping) his stream to know when to qeue into gorgcs game. It's not a new usage of the word, stream snipers often do that to get into games with streamers.
That's not what the person I replied to said.
Most broken ultimate in the game.
The power of EE.
Stream sniping has always meant watching a players's stream to see when they queue, and then queuing at the same time in the hope of getting a match with the player.\n\nStream cheating is watching the stream to cheat. Sniping not required, it could be as simple as tuning into a stream as soon as they play against them.\n\nPeople took it to mean that they're synonymous and so now stream sniping means watching a player to cheat.
Would have been a cool play if you didnt “?“ him. Except he did it before, then its ligitimate
if you play alot of party it adds that to your "overall rank" so solo can be lower but party higher ///net higher overall rank.
But the Chinese only win every second year. \n\n/s
/r/watchtinkerdie
JUST DO EET
That already happens.
:D
If you memorize which color matches to which hero sure. But doesn't that take some work?
gorgc is a big baby (or small child, w/e). Every game he uses every excuse in the book for not playing perfectly. Missed a cs? Must be stream snipers, better block the minimap (which is blocked in the screenshot and he's still complaining). Ulted an illusion? It's because his team is tilting him. Misclicked a shrine? Chat's fault for making him respond. \n\nThis is nothing new and rime certainly isn't the only person who he's said this to.
Not that strong? It is incredibly difficult to push high ground against a Tinker. Now factor in another 4 heroes and it becomes even more difficult.\n\nTinker does need a nerf, maybe an increase in mana cost for march, so that he can do less marches on high ground?
Pretty sure his favourite would be either Earthshaker or Axe
What if I walk up high ground and get hooked by a Pudge or chain stunned to death or hexed by a lion or force staffed into their team. You see my point? There are four other heroes that you also need to deal with, not only Tinker, and a lot of things can go wrong in a pub game. Help in lane? Hah, I rarely get help in mid, but somehow enemy supports gank me at least five times in the landing phase.
fiftEE fiftEE   4Head
I read this as:\n\n\n1st part \n\n\nI am having changes in my life and i am so cool with it i've never been touched by emotions it's just me haha\n\n\n2nd part\n\n\nYou thought i was arrogant but that isn't the case look how cool i am not arrogant at all\n\n\n3rd part\n\n\nI posted it because i wanted to, waow\n\n\nHonestly no one in their right mind would translate this delusional bullshit, just ignore it and imagine something amazing if you enjoy that behavior
I thought Jerax actually stuck at Ancients and then I realized it could be Ancients but then in the end it's actually Ancients.
&gt; googletransletor\n\nwhat is this googletransletor you speak of? new technology?
are u dumb
Fnatic ... has fans ?
its a r/csgo meme
You probably have no idea what you're talking about.
Yeah, because Tinker is gonna stand there all willy nilly with no supports around ready to root/stun/hex you and blow you up to smithereens, while their offlaner counter-initiates your team to cut them off from you. All the while everyone has been standing in triple-march. And then if Tinker isn't retarded when he sees your reckless behavior, he just buys BKB and suddenly you can't even control him easily in fights. 
That's some chuuni shit right there. And people think EE is living in anime in his head.
no, lvl 3 dragon slave
Get real, lol. 56 isn't even that good.
OP, don't bother, the whole post is basically gibberish of a 14-year-old edgy girl. Absolutely nothing of value.
Are you talking about using his stream to queue at the same time to increase the chances of getting into the same game with gorgc AKA stream sniping, or are you talking about watching the stream during the match to gain an unfair advantage AKA stream cheating?
You are literally the embodiment of dog shit dota players. If you have eyes and a brain you will see divine players play 10000000 times better than you do.
You probably misunderstood me. You really have no idea about how OpenAI works. You know shit.
Just saying that it wasn't as impressive as people say it is, there were some other plays that could've been made.\n\neh, average play. Obvious Tinker would rocket, so it would be stupid to not iron branch to that exact spot and even hide behind it a little first to make him chase you into tower range!, 5/10
#bingtranslator\n\nI've always been a realist, and I'm staying. I see the world as it is, no better-not worse, without any prisms. Due to the fact that I am very rarely guided by emotions-I can soberly look at things and situations, adequately assess my strengths, opportunities. To all other things I am a very straightforward person, always say what I think/feel at a particular moment in time.\nI'm not complaining or seeking support, I'm not asking you to understand me.\n\nWhat I'm all\n\nIn the last month my life has changed considerably and has played with new paints (mainly black-yellow), and those who follow my "activity" completely or at least for Instagram have probably noticed changes in that I speak and as I it Present. Where did that extremely self-confident upstart, which has everything "easy" and which makes "dry paddles" or beats all "lips"? Duck here and there was never, and the image was not. Just a collection of thoughts and feelings at a particular time in a somewhat comic form.\nGoing back to the topic of teams and my relationships with people..\nBecause I am a gentle and kind person in my own right to people whom I consider to be "loved ones", I have always tried to understand and adjust for the benefit of all, at least I thought so. Eventually people perceived my "kindness" for weakness, "sat on the neck", "weighed legs", tried to suppress well, and then we know what it usually ends. As practice shows this type of behavior, which I adhered to, at the distance absolutely does not work, and, probably, to some extent, it is great that I now defined it, albeit in such a "painful" way. And since the conclusions are made, now I can change everything in the beginning, to do things differently and I will put more maximum effort within the scope of its possibilities for this. For yourself and for the team.\nIt's incredibly hard to start everything from scratch, but I'll try my best.\n\nAll goodness and be happy.\n\nAnd yes, this post exists only because I thought it necessary to leave it here.
what if people started hating on "DAE SUPPORT XDD" heroes like crystal maiden or witch doctor etc? \n\ni dont get why people hate on those who play "high skill" heroes like tinker and invoker. if anything 95% of people here have no idea how to play those heroes effectively. i can almost guarantee no one in &lt;4k even gets travels+soulring+bottle within 15minutes

huh? i think u misunderstand. I mean its not as valuable as before. I used to feel like shit losing 25 mmr every time i lose but not anymore cuz i can still rank up even tho my mmr still stay the same. I didnt mean Divine player is the same as me Ancient. I just reply to OP who jokingly said "You underestimate the power of mmr" and then i reply to him like that, implying that 25 mmr is not worth ruining a friendship over. Did my comment really worth your time to spread your hatred toward another human being when u dont even fully understand what i mean.
I played quite a lot of party but i just screw around with friends and didnt win much. Oh and the game i ranked up, I played supp luna cuz my doom buy q-blade and take all my CS cuz he think i was party 3 and took all core role from his 2 man party but it was actually 3 solo and 2 party.
This is the appropriate response. 
OG is trash if you comparing them with secret, liquid, newbee. But they were at the same level with mineski, fnatic, kinguin and other tier 2 team.
Swede cuck perma-triggered.
it's crazy that first round lower bracket had OG, EG, and Newbee in it...(some would say EG probably sucks right now and rightfully deserved lower bracket) \n\nsecond round lower bracket also added Liquid...which poor Optic had to play against \n\n2 sets and you are out just feels so shitty...EF had to play Liquid AND OG? oh come on \n

Naw, been smilin' at mineski ever since mushi left.

Been a fan of fnatic since HoN, and seeing it cry itself to sleep while Uni's on it still hurts. What was once my favorite team with who I still think is the best offlaner (the position I main) out there is a spectral dagger to the heart lemme tell ya. Mushi was the last real breath of life I saw in fnatic, and now he's gone all I see is a budget team secret with all the same problems; breaks my heart.

HUGE name, the BIGLIEST name! :D
I don't like the concept of sin but I find having a system with laws, acts labeled as crimes etc better than believing in fiction.
Haha, this is so funny. how old are these guys? 
I know that. 
Why are you guys downvoting him fuckers.
I give you three fitty. 
Why is everything blanked out?

Honestly 33 went on and bkbd and instead of retreating with the team went in for kky and didn't even manage to kill him. Caused the whole team to be disconnected and CCnC blinked in since apparently the plan was to fight...
Maybe if you had a brain you will see that Brood did not miss her attack and the act of activating BKB applies a basic dispel, removing IB and stops Radiance debuff. The wiki disclaimer being there for exceptions.\n\nEdit: [Here](https://imgur.com/a/dxPBl) is the combat log showing Brood hit Bane for 30 damage in case you still can't comprehend shit.\n\nP.S. Stop spouting nonsense about game mechanics you don't understand.
I believe
Wait 'til Envy downvotes this. Kappa
Not necessarily, I personally went up 5 ranks ([pic1](https://prnt.sc/ii8c3o) [pic2](https://prnt.sc/ii8c7k)) and I only played maybe 2 ranked matches a day. Someone who plays more can climb way faster. For me it was a combination of not playing ranked in a while so I was lower MMR than my actual skill + getting lower MMR after the MMR reset.
With Chappie in your team you bet your ass it is 
Lags and stuttering. Absolute failure of a stream.  
Dude go take a chill pill, I already edited the original post to show you're right. I didn't know Incap bite didn't pierce bkb, I was wrong. When you know you're right, why are you getting angry?
God I wish people would stop complaining. You put millions of dollars to provide entertainment and then choose which platform to broadcast it through. They apologized, it's over. Bet you people would complain even if it was on TV prime time like a champion's league game because you can't spam a chat or write 14 year old "memes".
THI S IS GAMEBREAKING GOOD JOB OP FOR FINDING THIS\n\nOH \nMY GOD VALVE HOW COULD UU U U
People complain because the stream is literally down, what the fuck are you talking about?
*proud atheist right here*\n\nle tip for you m'sir 
Yeah, people already commented that, you don't have to tell me Captain Obvious 
r/iamverysmart
Yeah its shit. 480 p works for me, at higher I get the same issues.
When this happens to me, I will literally go grab someones arm, and forcibly high-five that shit.\n\nI want my goddamn celebratory gesture.
As it regularly is on twitch too. Wait times for hours normally, ESL actually one of the producers that are more rapid than others
For TI? It's February dude.
lmao you edited the post after I made the above reply and now you're acting like a victim?\n\n~~Stay classy~~ Thanks for confirming you are retarded
That's bullshit then, they should just reset the MMR 
I'm not acting like a victim, I read your reply after I checked the replay myself and posted the edit to not mislead anymore. I just think you're getting overly angry over something you're right on. If you're right, you can just present the facts and let them speak for you and not say "can't comprehend shit" and "spouting nonsense". And now you're calling me names after I admitted you're right.
smurfing isn't real XDDDDD\n\njust git GUD XDDDDDDDD
Well they don't start a hate campaign on twitch for each and every problem which is my point. Be glad ESL is willing to work with DotA 2 and spend all this money to have tournaments for this whiny worthless community
A 500 mmr player would not have to understanding of the game to deploy a gg branch there. Stop making yourself look like a degenerate
On my legend (2) I still report every tinker player every game with a message "fix that hero already". This fuck is too easy and too OP, you don't need to try much with this crap hero.
Rime is very annoying to play with even without him being a retarded attention whore trying to get attention on stream, let alone when he knows he has an audience.
Navi.Lil \n\nmore like 'Lil Navi LUL
thanks fam!
So lets say i calibrate at ancient 1 and fall down to 2000 mmr. Does that mean i will recalibrate as archon?
What are you having trouble understanding? It isn't even remotely comparable to an oil spill and I know you're being ironic but still. Their money, their choice of media. Stop the circlejerk, understand the world
&gt;Facebook is Daun\n\nFIFY
what the fuck do you mean by "doesnt survive" the two year contract? ESL is a big company involved in esports since decades,they wont die if some shitters on reddit dont watch the stream.\n\nFacebook already paid them.
Oh look,another thing to complain about,another thread for people to bash esl and facebook.\n\nSome people are so delusional,they think they are bankrupting esl by watching the game on twitch omegalul.
chinese dota is boring guys
Wait no, no, my friend. I am not smart at all. Before him, I'm powerless. I know nothing compared to the omnipotent being in the heaven. All my knowledge and wisdom are from him! Really grateful for being blessed with a mind capable of thinking straight. Even if I wasn't blessed an intelligence deserving of living with the society in harmony I would still be praising him because he has better plans for me. Me being autistic doesn't make me any less of a person when compared to normal beings and geniuses that moved civilization forward.  \n  \nI am blessed for living in a place where people don't die of starvation, public lynching, or pointless wars ran by propaganda. But how about my brothers in different and more extreme conditions (also, people die of starvation in my place, I live in a third world country where the rich people are religious leaders)? It's their fault for not believing in Jesus, that they cannot see the truth when there are more than thousands of gods that give a similar threat of eternal damnation. "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters" (Matthew 12:30; Luke 11:23). Hey, they believe in Jesus so this shouldn't be happening to them too, right? No! They had little faith and needed to pray more instead of taking actions that will actually improve the situation they are in.  \n  \nAll of these are morally correct, do not defy logic, and can be supported by the best rational philosophy which is "God works in mysterious ways."  \n  \nI have no idea if you intentionally put an 'e' instead of 'r', but I don't mind seeing this comment and the comment you have replied to on /r/iamverysmart/.
Classic throw by LGD lool.
chinese doto is boring guyzzz
you couldnt even pull a single viewer, 1k is a lot of viewers.
Hello! I would like to know what'ya mean by that. Is the 'tip' your comment commending me or are you mocking me, something like "tips fedora" which doesn't even make any sense?  \nIf the latter, then my reply would be [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7zcxjs/positivity_in_unranked/dunby7r/), else disregard the last sentence.
He uses WASD for movement, apparently.
LGD threw the game with the Troll and Rubick hunting the ES in the enemy base without support or BB on Troll.\n\nThey still would have had a chance if they let the bottom rax fall and wait for the Troll to come back instead of throwing away the divine rapier and epi by the time he was.\n\nI guess long close games like this often comes down to which teams slips up and makes a big mistake.
Still better than legacy keys. Maybe.
literal 1k garbage
ofc they cant ban, but what they can do is allow for more bans of heroes during the -ap ban stage. \n\nso instead of 3 heroes being banned, make it 10 - eliminates meepo, huskar, ench, pl, tb etc 
Noob here, why do you change camera with keyboard? Don't you do it with your mouse?\n\nPlease don't downvote.
I guess you were referring to me, when I said that 4k Tinker are clueless, compared to 5k Tinkers and 6k Tinkers, yeah they are completely clueless on positioning and even though they can farm like every Tinker out there, they keep dying in fights because they don't know where they need to blink and position in fight to be able to do damage while staying untouchable. \n\nAnd all this was about discussion how "Tinker isn't so strong right now" well I completely disagree with that sentiment, and said how it really depends on the bracket.
why are you blanking out his name lol\n\nalso i thought medals of the people in your game aren't displayed. 
would you please go fuck your mom then? I hate people like you that always jokes about stuff and not takes anything serious until someone gets hurt or something bad happens
Nerf him please, I hate storm so much, he's so fun to play, but it feels like such an empty victory once you get orchid and blood stone, it's almost too easy. 6 slot Storm is the best hero in the game, you feel invincible with that mana regen and linkens.
But you do realize that people don't play the same right? Fankefal is probably the best Tinker player I've seen, and he is nowhere near that level with other heroes. There are 4k Tinker players that are good, that doesn't mean that all of them are good, on the contrary most of them don't utilize strengths of the hero which is the reason why they keep being at 4k. Not even to mention that a ton of those "4k" players that pick Tinker are smurfs or boosters.
show me where I said that
Most people use WSAD, like basic movement in shooters.
Is uo is up in Bear language?
You are completely missing the point, but whatever, call me elitist if it makes you feel better. If you don't understand what I am trying to say, and somehow you feel attacked because you are at 4k bracket when I haven't even said anything about 4k bracket but 4k Tinkers, that's your problem.
Change blink dagger interaction with rearm in some way.\n\n\nMake every consequent rearm within a certain time period increase his mana costs exponentially. \n\n\nSoul ring unaffected by rearm.\n\n\nLaser miss chance definitely needs a nerf.
Gareth and Lacoste are really annoying idk why they get invites to events even casting qualifiers are waste on them
Didn't these clowns apologize for using Facebook already? 
Newbee is tilting.
Imo its stupid when you have an insane early game and like 15-0 but then you die once and you are on the losing side, thats why I'm afraid of being in a situation like SCCC is
Newbee is chinese navi. I want to cry and laugh at the same time
SCCC threw this game rofl
Lately Gorc hasn't had under 1,500 viewers atleast when I've tuned in. At best it stays at around 2,300 for the duration of the stream.
I never backed my argument by providing personal experience. My point is that 2D and 3D aiming are completely different environments which require separate muscle memory training.
press 1 skill = god. damn reddit never fails to amuse me rofl
I've watched so much anime in preparation of watching Fnatic/EE play.  My body and mind are ready.
My friends would never do that to me if I had any.
The turbo mode is pretty chill IMO though. I came back after seeing the new mode, suitable for a noob like me. \n\n"It's just turbo." - my pub team
Well lucky is over, 4 lose games straight and Fnatic will out.
I use wasd. Then all my hotkey are around that. Then I use mouse button 9 for camera grip
You can't connect your PC/Laptop/Tablet/SmartPhone to the TV?
God cop bad cop routine.
In general, 4k players are clueless. \n\nMost of 4k~6k games are decided through massive outpick on sup match ups against each other making the countered team's cores useless on mid game, or cores hardly countering other teams cores where the game ended after 40+ min regardless of gold advantage through the majority of the game.\n\nI don't think he's uber OP, but I do agree that if you do not pick proper counter to him you won't have near the sight of winning the game. And I hate when this fucking FACT happens to a hero; thankfully Invoker/Storm is not being over picked.
stops to play for me every 5 ~ mins so i have to get up and reload site rly annoying
Makes me a bit sad to not hear the talents and the casters we are used to listen to.\n\nBut well, it helps small time casters to get to the frontpage, so there's that !
It's kinda pathetic to seem him post instastories of him just watching the VP games alone begging for attention. 
They are fucking their product in favor of getting paid. It's completely on ESL.
Yes, because twitch has never borked in the middle of a tournament...
what was sccc holding his ult for? he kept waiting and waiting to use it and when he finally did, I think he got one. maybe two. feels like LGD would've been forced away from the fight if some of them were missing a lot more mana. 
So he is a big softie who likes to shit talk, got it.\n
You guys are on subreddit of probably the buggiest game in the world. STFU :)
bsj submode ResidentSleeper
I mean, if the alternative is not getting paid then i kinda understand why... 
Not according to this sub. They think EE is a garbage pos who is holding GODBED 10K back from achieving his deserved TI win. They think that EE singlehandedly makes the team tier 3 level.\n\nIgnoring the fact that Abed is the worst player on the team since he doesn't know what to do when he gets a lead and loses lane almost every game anyway, regardless of the match up.
I smell a troll because Dota is actually pretty fucking clean for a F2P game, it has less bugs than a lot of AAA games
lgdamefan you didnt see this one coming did you, you little shit xd
Must there be complaining about Fnatic in every match thread?
Blame newbee, not the format.\n\nKinguin outplayed newbee hard.\n\n
Kinguin stomped Newbee. So Fnatic had to beat a team stronger than Newbee. What's wrong with that?
Ame did a fucking ton early game so he could throw later. 
Yes. Because the format is bad.
Still better than EE's pipe builds.
FUCK ESL SoBayed FUCK FB SoBayed
After LGD got rekt by Secret, I am glad they lost to Newbee. They wouldn't have been able to get DPC points anyway imo.
I thought they were 37-2 and should be dominating in the major :thinking:
Just ban Naga and newbee power level is down by exponent of 2
F A C E B OMEGALUL OMEGALUL K
Hahaha!\n\nThis is perfect. ESL deserves this.
It does happen a lot with twitch. But redditards won't understand that. Always OH NO FACEBOOK IS BAD when facebook is down. When twitch is lagging like hell (happens a lot of times) they are silent.
so blame fnatic for getting to top 6 because newbee can't win v a shit team? LUL\n\nNewbee make it harder for themselves 
&gt; Meanwhile there's a peruvian raping them on a calculator and a lawn chair.\n\nThe only thing Peruvians are raping is some poor girl from Venezuela. 
F A C E B OMEGALUL OMEGALUL K\n
I can confirm that at the 5k bracket no one gives a flying shit about bugged effigies, and if they are annoying like yours they do notice it and flame you for the rest of the game, not sure if that's "worth thousands of dollars" like you said LUL
people in that thread definitely said along the lines of OG should beat anyone who is not Liquid/Secret/Newbee
haHAA i'm a 12yo coolhacker haHAA
Vici need to turn it up to eLeVeN and finally win a Valve event. Enough with the 2nd place. Probably what they feel anyway.
I used to do the same on a smurf with maintaining 70%+ winrate. \nWas mostly doing it with really fucked up team and picks which guarantees low chances to win already.
Must be a bug, like some profiles showing 38k rampages or whatever. If someone out there has gotten 49 kills over a thousand games of dota (or 5 kills over 10k) on a single hero that person the already be a legend 
I havent had a single problem and I've watched pretty much every game. Much smoother than Genting was.
so thatas what happens wwhen you put tinker on a real pos 1 and reso in a space create position. \n\n\n
L OMEGALUL L tail
Really dont wanna ride the notail hate train, but after watching this series its clear to me he is not on the same level as Miracle, Matu or Resolution.
Are you intentionally trying to say the most stupid shit a human brain can come up with, or are you trolling?
to be fair reso also never perform well in this major, he make few questionable play that throw the game
&gt; so thatas what happens wwhen you put tinker on a real pos 1 and reso in a space create position.\n\nWhat?
Honestly this format is complete dogshit.  Result of one bo1 decides whether you need to win 1 bo3 or 3 bo3s to make top 6
worst format ever with bo1 at upper bracket and bo3 at lower brackets. joke\n
Probably the worst game I've ever heard him cast.
wtf u sayin dude. This loss was largely due to Fly's drafting. Even if reso or anyone playing the *2nd pick tinker* it can do very little with Liquid drafting esp that last pick NP.
The first game was not a drafting problem, they(especially reso) just threw the game by overextending in the early game so many fucking times, it was ridiculous. I mean they dove between 2 towers to get an elder titan and reso died for it, while liquid got a tower too.
Never tought that Facebook being down would reach the front page of this sub.\n\nThanks ESL LUL
Literally unwatchable.
OG game 2 draft so bad, tried to get real clever. Ns seems like a major fail, 0% wr?
&gt; Liquid is half tier above OG\n\nThis is the most retarded comment I've read in a while.
There is a 3rd place match? Wow, really? That's something new and pretty stupid
time for EE to learn his place... soon they will face liquid in the quarterfinals and then go home without a single DPC points... :)
U r also the retard if u didn't get it.
man, what is Twittern?
oh the cameraman ruined it when he showed that they were porting on this creep... 
that's not my point. nobody shoved btm wave at all. midone was defending the tower  but that's it he went to mid directly. when the common thing to do is to at least kill 2 creepwaves before leaving otherwise that would happen.
ugh of course esl clips that after they see us talking about it on reddit.
At this point I feel like if a platform is equal to twitter in any aspect but the chat (or just emotes), people will still complain (no, I'm not suggesting FB is already at this level, just generally speaking).
Does this shit site work on firefox ?
Fast as G2A
Hi
&gt; Fixed a bug where hovering over an enemy ability button would show a range indicator if the ability was leveled up. \n\nno\n
and thus, features become bugs
Terrorblade buff
fffffuuuuuuck, that's a Pudge buff.
that's what i'm saying but now ESL is trying to take credit for what we found.  they can't do anything right.
Alright, wheres my fucking game-play changes. Valve no bamboozle
That's dumb AF. that's a really great feature
and so the feature becomes a bug lul
That's been in the game for years, how could that possibly be a bug 
But nothing can replace Twitch chat. That's the best thing. It gives audiences sense of standing in a crowd.
Thank you  finally someone who  doesn't have a mindset of a 2k mmr. that gets what I mean. \n\n
I don't know how Underlord has gotten away without getting a nerf. He has been popular since the tail end of 7.06 
&gt;Skillcap doesn't mean information should be hidden behind obscure mechanics/bugs.\n\nWhy not?
Don't think he had time to move in the 2 weeks he was on that team.
idk, they could just have stalled and won anyways lol
Fucking retarded sing sing got this shit removed.\n\n
ESL boss is pretty new to the scene. Give him a break. He's just out of college, the poor kid hasn't learned the ropes just yet. 
Item checking is generally fine because items aren't constantly changing in the middle of a fight. The only time they change is when they stop by a secret shop or the courier delivers an item, but that's part of the strategy layer because you can just outright surprise the enemy with a BKB or some other impactful item coming out of fog. You also can't see item cooldowns, so they don't really have the same impact as "oh storm's out of mana, time to gank him" and such.\n\nChecking mana in a fight, while sometimes stressful, isn't very skill intensive. If you, for instance, want to check the Storm's mana so you can ult him as AM, all you have to do is click him once and look at the bar's position. Numbers don't matter and hardly any time is wasted, it's just a tedious action that could be made faster by just having them displayed by default. Hell, with the unit query panel (I believe that's the name?) all you have to do is click storm and you have access to his mana for the entire fight, pretty much.
Could honestly be fixed by just not showing the used mana until the ability is visible to the enemy. And besides, can't you already do all of this by using the unit query panel?\n\nIllusions would only affect Phantom Lancer, really, since his are the only that copy that cast animation of his nuke, if I recall correctly. Not to mention, there's already a bug that pretty much reveals the real Phantom Lancer that Valve hasn't bothered to fix. Otherwise, you could also just make the illusions mimic the mana bar of the real hero. Not like they use it for much anyways.
I speak for the trees…. (James)
thats one thing i love about dota and valve and icefrog, alot of bugs arent taken out until it seems its signifigant enough to. so its about finding the bugs to exploit.   \nlike i think this is only taken out cuz if holding skillpoints is like going to become meta the whole balence of the game would get fucked
TBF It's called map awareness It doesn't require 200 IQ to deduce that Ancient is low on HP and can be taken easily. The title LOL
It should also have been radiant, not dire.
people say ohaiyo was right LUL
Miracle could fart and reddit would freak out about how amazing he is.
Hero has had insane winrate in pubs for so long. A wonder he hasn't been nerfed more.
Honestly fuck you i almost forgot\n\n
I think redditards are incapable of detecting sarcasm or something unless it's in a reply to sarcasm.  \n\n  like sarcastic comment downvoted to hell, sarcastic reply upvoted  \n\nwhy is the average reddit user a gibbering retard
He's the best offlaner in Dota history
they clearly won that game *despite* envy, not because of him. Im not sure if theres ever been a game of dota won because of him.  They are lucky to pick up universe. 
why the hell are you getting downvoted. Fntic just capitalised they didn't do anything that special, Secret just messed up big here.
EE is a well known bullshiter
Actually League has a very similar ult with less range that doesn't require an allied target
This HAS to go on DotA watafak
They all pushed without buybacks?
Such knowledge. You're a genius. WAOW! 1!1!1!!
She's a girl btw\n\nEdit: dude is fine I guess
Yes I know his name is in the filing from Riot maybe in 2018 people will realize what a joke is. 
Def not top tier but currently multiple spots ahead of fnatic despite fnatic buying points.
Don’t overload with them with stuff to release..will\nDelay the battlepass another month for them to implement this
Almost makes me forgive that he's a virtue signaling idiot. Almost
Did bulldong say “the bae”?
Fuck Blitz, he defended ESL.
sounds like porn
He sucks his own dick so hard. That and calling out DJ for not microing serpent wards that had aghs split shot was super annoying.
Faith Bian changed the game 
The dude really makes obs camera work an art. I'm pretty sure the only thing preventing him from getting an invite is that non-PC name. drop the "Pimp" or just go by your name, surely you'll get an invite.
You fags know that you can activate quiet mode right?
S4 would like to have a word with you. 
Yeah, nice try, I see you're putting shit on Twitter ESL, but still, fuck you, fuck Facebook, I'm still not watching any of your streams.
In reddit's attempt to boycott and diss facebook we have had to deal with some shoddy casting.
So true. With their shitty fbook platform we miss out on some vintage tobiwan hype casting. BSJ and bulldog are great for casual but I really like the mineski and german ones just for being so damn excited.
just google Hitler Sportpalast.
Idk if fnatic saw Ace's TP is on his backpack and he wouldnt have enough time to use it.
woosh urself redditard lmfao 
Ah the classic "new player here. this game is great!" post.\n\ndelusional dotards so easy to bait for karma.
It takes a decent amount of degeneracy to make this about yourself, holy shit
I think the best part is cyborgfatt bending over to grab one of the many spare monitors off the floor to give to puppey
philiphino is the stronkest race xd
Well in case you didnt know Twitchs new rules were such a joke and got so much flack from perrty much all of us they delayed the new rules for a month or two. Regardless you cant stop this ever its going to happen get used to it and just play. The chance of you running into a bought account are so lil its almost never going to be a reason you lost.
HAHAHAHAHA yea ok dude, its not hard to deal with its impossible its a free to play game. Theres almost no steps valve can take that will stop them without hurting the legit players you idiot. Its exactly why nothing has been done yet but you put your tin foil hat on and keep coming up with bullshit with that 20% you brain dead moron.
I love his channel very educational
he did saw yapz tp, I like to think that's why he fist+chain there
he did saw yapz (and the ring effect when tp) for a split second there though, not so sure if he really targeting yapz or ace, maybe he just want to disable some of them to give more time to hit throne even so slightly
Pls don't add chatwheel sounds back. After all the changes to reports'n'whatever my games are so enjoyable. I can communicate with people. People flame less. I haven't met turks and arabs in my games even once.\n\nAll of that would be wasted on this cancerous xddd funny meme which ppl tend to overuse and turn the game into a complete shitshow. I don't want to mute my teammates. I just don't want to listen to this annoying crap. \n
Damn, so many Secret misplays with TP scrolls. Thanks for the vid
He got this sponsorship like a week ago. For the past months he only played on main. So i dont know what you guys are talking about
omae wa mo
you can still encounter boosters. few games, high winrate, mostly plays 1v5 cores, heroes like huskar/meepo/invoker/tinker
Somethings I found out \n\nUber = Dark Rift (they said EE tried to catch the uber but got swapped by VS)\n\nMongoloid/Mongosaur= EE for being baited at around 50 min mark (they got pissed because he should have just went for the tower.. objective gaming)\n\nLoL \n\n
Dunno why you got downvoted. Its just a question not an insult. 
To be fair, in my whole Dota 2 days I don't recall any account boosters. As in None. Maybe sometimes people have a bad day or are inexperienced with the hero they got, that's fine. I personally don't find 800 MMR players playing in Very high skill games (EU WEST). I was around 4k and don't play much ranked lately but I am more worried about smurfs to decrease my game enjoyment (and new player due to my nice behaviour) and I am pretty sure that Valve (despite the hate some people have here) is smart enough to estimate the weight of account boosting and act accordingly.
Dont try to reason with reddit. Lazy developers, Valve has changed, they only want moneis.
Good one. It's like Mineski cast with less shitstorm.
He invoked Deafening Blast then Universal Dark Rifted into Steve a second later. Invoker had no aghanims and Invoke was cd for 5 more seconds.
yea and fata pings (prolly for sunstrike) it I guess midone is kinda confuse on that play. Abed getting the best luck to cancels yapzor tp. what a game.
This type of comments really makes me laugh. The way you describe it i feel like im reading about a school shooting, not a fucking meaningless thing like a video game. They didnt even try to run while he killed them, dear lord im tearing up...
So abed meant to chain and kill Ace, but he got lucky and chain cancel TP Yapzor instead.  \nNot salty by saying it was only luck, but his camera not even see Yapzor TP, but still an amazing play.
&gt; rants about how his friends got addicted to this game that is comparable to drugs and cancer\n\n&gt; ends rant with "game is good" - "community isnt"
No he 100% did. He used it specifically to cancel as many TPs as possible, though he was more looking for the cancel on Midone's TP.\n\nYou're not always looking dead on center of your screen dude. Especially not if you have 10k MMR
Name a game that has as many players that got rid of any problem - Boosting/Account Selling/Hacks???? Oh right none of them - Dota 2 - Still at an all time high on this shit. Pubg - highest of any game and still going with hacks.   Overwatch still huge on hacks - CSGO Huge on hacks have to literally go to ESEA to have a decent time rofl thats pathetic. Rocket League - Account boosting to the max. No matter what people will be able to do it and get away with it for a very VERYYYY long time there is no possible thing that can remedy this that was my point so yea you can pretend all you want the facts are on the paper buddy its a nasty thing going on and zero fix in sight or the next 5-10 years. Valve has said smurfs are fine....and all your ideas bring false positives no matter what so yea theres a reason no company does what you say.
At first i was baffled by the tp scroll icons in this video since none of those would matter anyways\n\n\nAND THEN I SEE COMMENTS ABOUT THEM\n\n\n\n\nADFJLHGHKAYIFLKLKHGJadkljlkfklazflakjlfjak

Stop with the whiney titles please. There are other ways to let people know without these whiney titles. Thanks for taking the time to inform us though!
He've been repeating it in the same high pitched voice since he first got attention and it wasn't even fun to begin with
Yeah, but i feel he doesn't contribute to the panel imo. At least Slacks has a niche that he carved out for himself, Pyrion just repeats what the other panel members say by changing the phrasing. 
Here's a challenge for you all. Find one booster who isn't Russian.
If you dont see how much Wings changed the game, there is no reason to have this conversation 
FB Stream is really sucks honestly.\n\n
Not the Gambler DansGame
I found image on google
Literally same
True, Slacks isn't a analyst but I never said he is fulfilling the role of one, He makes the panel fun while Pyrion tries to be both and thus fails at making the panel fun to listen to imo. 
THere is no need to ban account actually, the thing needed to be done is hardware ban for boosters and account sellers. 1 ban and they are not able to play dota untill they buy new pc/ change most of pc parts
Or, just maybe, when a new account wins 20 games crushing all enemys. Suspend it or stop it from playing ranked för a while. That would at least make boosting harder and more timeconsuming -&gt; higher prices -&gt;less demand -&gt;fewer boosters.
Is that really a problem, though? I mean, if all goes fail, you can just go to next game. What's the big deal with surrender? Just join a new game, dude. It's not like surrender is the end of the world lol\n\nI feel like people care too much about surrender to the point they don't understand how much less stressful and fun it makes DotA.
How does it feel to be this retarded?\n
Undress and lie down. I'll bring oil and condom
or they go in party lycan/brood, clinkz,  omni/huskar so many high skilled players on 4k+ bracket that dont even belong there, I had many games ruined and had 1 day ban for flaming my boosted players dat stood afk farming midas with trent (reporting me after game). 60% of games I played on Ancient 1 are boosters/ boosted players  I swear to god.
ULT suggestion:\n\nReveals all enemy heroes on the map for X seconds.\n\n(Vision follows the hero on a 400unit radius) [No Truesight after cast + Dodge able with smoke/euls/usual dispels]
You're expecting him ruining tens maybe even hundreds of games by smurfing just to benefit his own channel would change my opinion about it? I was just suprised he managed to make one of the best finishes of all time about himself so I mentioned it. Great if you're learning tho, good for you
I mean...please correct me how I’m wrong?
What one of these statements is false?
It destroys your brains ability to produce the chemical that makes you feel self esteem. It also is a very short lived high and stupid expensive.  It is unsafe to do it rn because of fent. \n\nI mean I'll try anything once but cocaine is one drug where I was like wtf why do people get so addicted? Is not that good. 
People who are hating on qSnake probably have 2k mmr (basically reddit)
Can't draw square PepeHands
Why does he spend 90% of the game on max zoom out?\n
Yes. Thats why I m not selling anything just yet
You'd have to be really dumb to think that that's why Valve implemented phone numbers for ranked.
Windranger is so bad
is he really selling accounts? i remember this guy just making 40 smurfs because he managed to get every single one into endless low prio pools before reaching 5k because he's such a toxic awful moron
Well, i didnt see that it is that trival during overwatch ban waves. LAN  cafes wont have 80-90% winrate over a year.
So what i learned from this is midone is 2k scrub- should have invoke sunstruck and killed steve the MVP creep. What a noob i could have made that play wkth my eyes open
not entirely, but when a person dedicates a lot of time in playing Dotes and still lower rank, I am sure that IQ is a huge part of it. My experience shows that these players just simply DO NOT UNDERSTAND the little things like: farming gives more advantage in the long run, the optimal builds/timing/hero composition, how little things like orb walking increases efficiency (efficiency in general), how being toxic is counter productive etc etc.\n\nHeck I see myself (as 5-5.5k) and my shortcomings in intelligence when i compare to some better players
well done, though you should really take the ice path talent at 25. the macropyre talent only gives it +45 dps (56 with aghs).\n\nwhich is nothing compared to the extra 1.25 seconds of stun.
I won't dissappoint. I will make sure of that.
Faceb OMEGALUL OMEGALUL ock
Look at the notes for the item in question. (and post them, because I'm too lazy to check it myself)
Gold.
Hmm. Good point. I'm sorry for my arrogance, but I won't retract my goals.
who cares? qsnake is a russian trash, whove failed in every other aspect of life other than boosting accounts anyways
I'm so incredibly surprised that it's once again a russian guy! Who would've guessed that they have no morals?
Too bad banning boosters and account merchanters doesn't bring Valve any money...
As support main, for early game, I think buying a dust is core’s role. I keep a sentry all the time, but can't afford more than that.
I've heard it used for any attack at all, just the act of walking in the down time between attacks. I expect the name just carried over because it's more important on these heroes as they are primarily attacking and rely on that extra movement.
Maybe he wanted that extra slow :)
blink dagger
Who else would he blame ? Allah ?
i call your bullshit an utter bullshit
&gt; By playing League you automatically have an IQ in the single digits\n\nEnough with this attitude, please.
It follows the enemy heroes. And if its 10-20 secs it's very much effective.
It doesnt follow the hero. Last too less of a duration.
"Hardware bans are trivial to bypass" - depends how you do them tbh.\n\nAlso it boggles my mind how game devs aren't using TPM to do this and prevent people using other types of cheats. Not everybody has TPM but you can isolate the people who do from the people who don't.
&gt;2Mbps  \n&gt;2018  \n\n&gt;pretty bad
I know but I mildly wanted to know if I'm right
glimmer cape?
So like every Russian ever
You are right.
Dota's not the first Valve game that implemented it. They saw the stats from CSGO, and thought they were good enough to put it in Dota as well.\n\nWithout seeing the statistics I can only guess the results from my own anecdotes. I had 4 CSGO accounts I played on, after the update I only played on one. With Dota getting phone number registration as I added a phone number to a second account that I can smurf on in both games. That, and talking to people I play with I'd say the effort required to play ranked on two accounts probably reduced the amount of smurfing going on.\n\nIn addition if you get VAC banned you have to get another phone number which slightly increases the amount of effort for cheaters.
Thank you. I am saved.
wow, thank you :)\n\nThe gesture counts. &lt;3
This is precisely what makes me wild. Knowing I'm playing with idiots with Smurf or booster accounts. I can't win it, they can taunt me, and I can't leave either. It's annoying knowing you could've done something much better with that hour.
&gt; Redeye's dedication to the game lost him his family PepeHands\n\nSource?
I'm not not serious btw. Should have put a smiley on my reply. 
All right, guys, I've made a deal with myself that I will grind at least 100 MMR a day, so that I'll have at least a 3k boost once a month. \n\nAs it gets harder, I suspect I will want to cut that in half, so that it's 50 MMR a day. But we'll see. Perhaps not. I expect a lot of sleepless nights trying to recover a lost game's points. 
Overrated player
ok. I see where you coming from but I witnessed with my own eyes how MANY of my friends played a lot and tried to improve but with no avail. Upon talking to all of them who did try, felt like they are much slower and primitive in understanding basic things = lower IQ.
LUL
It's still not confirmed if Mars is a hero, we just had icons and strings attached abed to them, they could be neutral abilities or item abilities since the art on the icons was not that neat
You really don't need practice to get in the ancient/divine brackets, altho you need to play regularly. Of course getting to top 1000 may require some degree of practice.
valve are fucking punks man, they'll do fuck all against scripters/cheaters/ddosers/scums like this guy/toxic ass pro players.\n\nfuck valve sometimes, legit.

That is so stupid to say. Of course every single item in the game will have some benefit if you can buy it.

You miss the point.

All day? All you have to do is check the channel and you know what's up in 5 seconds.
finishing any degree its just matter of patience and perserverance, the same comes in dota, if you keep playing you will become better whit time, yes, the times that 2 peaple take to reach the same goal can be diferent, it does not mean one have more IQ than the other, just one undestand the learning process better than the other
PepeHands
"Really dumb" Ah yes they added phone numbers so Valve could give me a call for whatever reason.. \n\nJokes aside, what /u/Deltidsninja said is pretty much correct. Having to constantly add a phone number will deter people because they'll either need to get a new SIM card or buy a number online, sure it might be cheap but it still requires payments and such. \n\nDoes it always work? Nope. At least there's something in place to try reduce it I guess..

You don't sound like you're a team player. Like at all. Supports buy sentries to deward and to avoid invis ganks. Dust is something cores should be carrying if they want to get aggressive. Have you ever faced a Riki/BH/Clinkz/Slark/DK/SF as a support? Not fun. We can MAYBE see them coming with a well placed sentry but as for Dust...yeah we can't afford that AND provide you with wards around the map. At best, we carry around 200 gold max for the first 5 - 10 minutes. We can't splurge that while also buying observers and sentries. You get to pick - vision or dust. You won't get both.
See i guess a former teamate spotted
Sounds like you don't have a clue how to support and are just making excuses so you can rush for that aghs instead of actually support. Watch high MMR games in client sometime and learn something instead of trying to gimp your fucking core. \n\nThere will be times when the core will get detection to help when the supports aren't doing well but that is not the standard, remotely. \n\nStop claiming you're a support just because you're not taking the last hits.
This quarterfinals isnt in front of the crowd? WTF
Eg is still tier 2 imo

Madara Uchiha Vs Hashirama Senju
liquid won 2-1 so i suppose they lost that game\n\n \nEDIT: nvm the game indicator is just wrong
Why? Because ones wearing black and the other white? Fucking racist. That’s a permaban. 
So according to you  Mind_Control is from the MiddleEast, since you know Kuroky is a German?
Well Bulgaria used to be under Ottoman rule, so if Kuro (German by way of Turkey) is Middle Eastern, let’s just lump MC in there too. 
It's really odd that Fata didn't have it on normal cast, anyone who's played Pugna should know you can't play with Life Drain on quick cast.
Brood pickers are evil
are people really doing that?
I think you just associate the black clothes they wear with evil, and that means you suffer from racism. Sorry to bring you the bad news OP.
I knew someone will somehow spin this into a racism story. Nope. I am just judging based on facial expressions, crop the faces and you will notice Liquid are overall more relaxed
How does SuperPuro manage to comment something stupid even when he's off of this website?
And of course fucking Puro is there to try his best to ridicule people on Twitter aswell LMAO

Yes, it's a bad time to carries more are usually playable. Miracle- used to play different carry every game but he is now tied down only to a handfull of heroes.

Let's be honest, if any team is evil, it's either Liquid or OG.
yea but did you try turning it on and off again?
he's the human incarnation of /r/iamverysmart\n\nhe got banned from this subreddit couple weeks ago
Puppey stole money from his players in the first 3 iterations of Secret, so yeah. 
Then it will be "who is the richest" game. I don't think a dota player will play this game more than 50+ hours in a year. This game is dead before born imo.
Listen to me Gaben. This should be released on The International.
As a Chen spammer, I don’t think artifact will interest me.
Dancatpro quit reddit because he got bullied too hard for his awful posts here. Gayfarang pretended to kill himself then made another account, later demanding to become a mod on /r/dota2circlejerk, which he has no with no perms. Goblintechies sold his reddit account for money.
Cancer patient. 
ohhh wow. he got pissed because of that. damn 
Trust me I play HS. It's not about who the richest is. Not by far. It does help but you just can't throw money at it and expect to be legend. 
You are fucking stupid, there is no quest.
Here I thought it'd be Invoker...
You are doing this in a private lobby. The quest only activates in Single Draft.
u see that tribal sharpie tattoo on miracle arm? its his legacy blessed from the finest TB himself , and manta dodge is his middle name

what is this? I'm so confused
The joke was that Invoker is so bad right now he would be lowest even with Aghanims.
He streams everyday what are you talking about
he's the guy who kicked you right? are you salty?
I'd say he's hands down the worst mid hero right now actually.
TA and Lina are definitely not worse, Alchemist is about the same, he would work in specific drafts. I'll give you Leshrac though, he is legit garbo.
Keep in mind she is played as support and in stupid dual off lanes and shit.
Someday this may be fixed BlessRNG 
someday...
That is a really sad Sniper. \nCan you get that many deaths any other way than just running down a lane and feeding? I’m seriously curious.
Unplayable until this is added
I remember that dude, had a massive fuckin meltown against me when i said 'maybe the meepo double damage nerf was okay' \n\nFunny shit lmao 
Dude is obsessed with MMR even though nobody gives a fuck and Meepo was free MMR if you were just okay with him back then\n\nEdit: his twitter is almost entirely him posting his MMR even though he has ~3 followers on twitter who aren't bots or big users who follow back to be polite and then keep private accounts\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dancatpro?lang=en

dont you mean dronedronedronedronedronedrone
Turn the lights off morons!!
Same here my use of mic which I actually  only use to notify people when we should push and when enemy team is  rosh, brought me to 48h mute ban. IK your feelings. xd
We will die until then
You have to walk outside -10 degrees. Inside pass for staff or premium. Lmao joke.
Thats so many deaths thats actually impressive. If it is a game under 50 Minutes that would be highly impressive.
You might be thinking about Bulldog’s infamous ‘Zerg rush’. It was a lot of fun watching the enemy team just sitting in base trying to fend off wave after wave of treants. Of course this was way back when Bulldog was actually playing professionally so ages and ages ago.
You could die 39 times without intentionally feeding if the enemy fountain camps for ~40 minutes.
Not to burst your bubble, but sets that are one of the main ways of monetization of Dota are pretty much account locked and rare stuff is obtainable through opening many cases only. Similarly in csgo, "ultra rare" items aka Knives are very rare unboxes only. 
Like sex and chocolate 
also proximity mines should take 2 hits from units like everything else
It is like you need to play league of legends
Boring
morons
Average snipers have a GPM below 200. that's astonishing...
please make sure eg beats vp, i want eg vs fnatic.\n\nthank u very much
Nice try ESL. 
morons

I've uninstalled and reinstalled Dota 4 times this week. Damn internet too fast #1stworldproblems
This games all about communication , good that you've picked up on it! What server are you ?
There's no situation where morph is pickable. He's gutter tier trash now sadly. Troll doesnt exist in a meta where razor does. PL is the only one whos alright rn
that isnt an one situation. it can be ran against most lineups provided they dont see it coming, check liquid in TI7 for example. you also need to build a lineup around it and play around timings, thats why its so rare
fuck no, that's the only thing that doesn't make me report techies pickers every game. It keeps me sane
who cares man
Hahahahahahah, I defiantly did NAZI it coming, get it?? haHAHA have good day you marvelous bastard!
Could have been good if they got someone else to play CM. Awful voicing that sounded forced, dubbed over and just off.

Sorry I did not mean to make you insecure about your weak justification for suffering
My mother lenguage is not english but the leak said:\n&gt; He's over the last year and a half  or so, not been doing so much balance\n&gt;Now he's back doing most of it.\n\nWhat I understand for this is that Now, like right now is balancing again but since 709 he didn't.
ESL never watching your stream as long you are on facebook sorry it's so bad I like to have cancer then look at it.

They don't have a "problem".\n\nDo you even realize what a caricature is. Do you think Kings on old Portraits looked exactly as they were painted? You always pain the person in a flattering light. And it's really hard to do that to all the nerds in digital sports. Except for Arteezy ofc. 
Look at college boy over here, having good ideas and stuff.
You dont need to be an ass to a guy who is trying to help you.

22  Deaths on Sniper are average? WTF? 
it was terrible, I'm sorry, I did not enjoy it one bit. No offense intended to any famous personalities acting in it. I don't know any of them and thought it was a pile of hot garbage.
thanks I just didnt had VLC 3 . Still buffering :/ I guess my internet provider has shit connection to facebook. Feels pretty sad to have buffering with 400Mbps
https://i.imgur.com/zeDqly0.jpg
OMG ThE MACROPYRE
This is extremely cringy.
It mean that ever since a year and a half ago (probably after he's done with 7.0) he hasn't do any balance but now he's back (so probably he's back for 7.09 and beyond)
the formula of evaluating the average must be an idiot.
Well for now there is no quest, only some kind of glitchs or bugs. It's nothing like the other quest or even the easter egg of monkey king. 
&gt; there is no quest on 7.09 since icefrog is supposdly not balancing...\n\nI was mostly refering to this part where you said that he is not balancing cause he **is** balancing since "now".\n\nThe rest of my comment was a mixture of leak and Icefrog tweet where he said "**We** want to try taking a different approach". Why would he make a tweet on behalf of something he isn't part of.
Well done? Cringe fest.
no
Stay stupid forever.
I don't feed on purpose, but I do have a couple of heroes I only pick when I assume to lose or don't try to win. Main one being Nature's Prophet, because he *could* cliff jungle so well.\n\nOnly because I couldn't afford an abandon, or didn't want to, &amp; only did it when my team was raging &amp; picking stupid picks at the start... or just the picks alone for me.\n\nI'm not proud of this, I'm just saying some people just don't want to spend 40+min on a match with things stressful sometimes, &amp; don't want to eat the abandon while the ones causing the stress get away scot-free.
Stay herald forever.
PUBG except you get the feeling sooner.
TL ; DR\n\nJust win the game LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL 4HEad
Apparently ESL has people paid to downvote any dissenting comment lol
well done PogChamp! I want to see the twitch chat reaction too pls.
Way easier to focus and stay cool in a 1v1 where your team isn't flaming you.
What the fuck
With that gpm, u can be a bad support
techies is garbage and so are people that play the hero
6 monitors but only 2 eyes 
Apparently ESL has people paid to downvote any dissenting comment lol
Absolutely. In OW, when my own team picks 4+ dps I just pick Mei. I never pick Mei otherwise.\n\nShe's a fun hero regardless of whether my team tanks and/or heals.\n\nI don't do the same in DotA because I happen to like supping in this game, but I can't blame anyone who's sick and tired of 4 carry teams. I don't support feeding but by the third and fourth pick we all know what you should do. When you refuse to do it so will I. I don't owe selfish fucks a goddamn thing.
i don't think shouting in the movies is a good idea or similar to commenting on a reddit thread
Sumail not mid..\n\nsad frikkin life!
that's not a thing
Its about how he suggest tbh.
It's a meme. Wut?

When after 4 years, EG was finally beaten up by VP, you know something is not working out.
Holy Shit its a FUCKEN JOKE YOU FUCKNUT. DONT TAKE SHIT SERIOUS ON REDDIT YOU FUCKING DIPSHIT LOOKIN SON OF A BITCH. HOLY HELL
NA LUL \n\nTrash tier team, Fear should leave that garbage squad. 
and EG placed the same as secret, even though this sub said secret is on another level from EG\n\nwho cares dude\n\nedit- dam, euros found my comment
Gisalikway na nimo ang kapubrihon? hahahaha!
EG needs better drafting, cant lose every game by outdraft despite playing a lot better than the enemy team
Like Nahaz said, there's so much expectations and mounting pressure on EG to perform. A lot of us know what that feels like, so let's just support them through this; they will be back.
Yeah trash tier team 35 min 2-0 vs newbee and lost a close series to\n\nAlso use of twitch memes clearly indicates a euro-ape
Nah EG just do the most predictable drafts of any non-Chinese team.
EG? Pro Circuit Points? SoBayed
eg cant be outplayed
Congratz to VP for beating a cancerous draft from EG they deserve to be in top 4\n\nEG LUL\n\nUniversal was and Is the problem
Your mom is an ape, you salty burger eater. \n\n"CLOSE SERIES" O M E G A L U L
The RTZ Major curse is just too strong. Or maybe not a curse, maybe just not good enough :thinking:
shoutout to esl for having a fucking second of audio lag, unless it's just me on every single pc on my house
These overused memes are giving me cancer.
Sumail is so weak. Only thing he's great at is being an arrogant and cocky player. Nice. Let me taste some your EG fanbois tears. So fuckin delicious. YUMmmMmmY..
So which NA teams are still playing? How do they rank versus other regions right now? 
none, universe and EE are NA's last hope
EG was 5th going into this Major.  He probably has not checked the updated standings because Liquipedia has already awarded 4th place points to all the semi-finalists.
I'm a TB player and a Liquid fan and I admit that the hero is really strong right now but it does not need a huge nerf though.\n\nThe way you beat a TB is the way you beat an AM. Contest his lane and shut him down, but this is really hard to do against teams like Liquid because they are willing to sacrifice 2 lanes in order to allow Miracle- to have a good start and get his early game items ( Treads, Aquila, Yasha+Lance) which allows him to safely jungle + split push.\n\nThe issue with Terrorblade is not only his strong talents late into the game, but it is the way you can safely get farm without worrying about getting ganked ( ace Vs. Liquid )\n\n
Hehe. Pero padayon ang mga pagsulay ?
I got the point from the other 1000 posts about this EG lost but so did your secret so stop with these shitty posts 
I believe its time for EG to kick Europeans because they're the reason we're losing. SUmail and RTZ played like gods, its Crit that is the problem. If we bring back PPD with a full american team, EG will easily win TI8
True 
All NA teams are now out of this tournament. EG is the best team currently out of NA followed by Col and then Optic probably. Overall the NA region seems to be worse than EU and China. ~~I'd say on par with CIS and SEA and better than SA.~~\n\n\nEDIT: Have been proven wrong, NA had really bad results compared to the other regions. Should've looked more at the results overall. Wasn't really on my mind. Shouldn't really claim stuff like this when I'm considering everything! :)\n\nJust remember to stay friendly! :)
Wtf are you smoking dude ha ha 
It's like fucking Stock Market/Crypto Trading. Lmao
Haha i was trolling, NA is trash, CIS is way better, look at VP, ez win for them. 
Get zai back for the bois
Trash region. 
So creative, wow, 10/10.
&gt;  full american team\n\nLMAO you do realize that Sumail is from Pakistan and Arteezy is Canadian/Uzbek, right?
the only shit i see here is you
Living in america is what has turned them into top2 best players in the world
God it's so refreshing to see SumaiL lose. 
I only play once or twice a month vs bots now because of how bad the community is on this. You know ow like they region lock China with certain games. I feel doing the same with Russia in Dota may benefit the toxicity I sleight bit 
Expected result, first real T1 team that's not in shambles (Newbee throw) and bye bye EG
Yes they removed it for a reason, and they will never reimplement it
oh yeah maybe, most people here who flame EG are just loud europeans so I kind of just assumed
After EG loss I have no idea what to do with my life, guess I will go ahead and ruin the other game threads now that NA teams are out like I do every major
That is above his average?!\n\nThis has to be a feeder/bot account.. 
Ohaiyo gets a cut of the winnings too
Avg kills 2 and death 22 are you the sniper of all the shit 2k games I played? 
This is honestly sad.
It's a troll.
Hijacking top comment.\n\nReally sorry for EG to be honest. They tried really hard to comeback with some good ganks which all were spoiled by commentators. It was clear to see that without soundproof booths VP immediately reacted to calls by commentary. Can’t really understand such decision from organizers for such a big tournament.
The draft was equal at best if not slightly VP favored.
time to take your crazy pills
I am only 2k but I could probably have bigger impact than fear did these games
The draft was even at best.
This is especially annoying among crybaby supps in SEA. Like, the easiest way to lose is to give up, so I'd really appreciate it if they could stop bitching.
Fans like you makes me wanna scream EG to loose as early as possible, after looking at ur comments 
Arteezy is Azeri/Nagornoese not Uzbek
Super easy? Newbee were in the way......
5.5k and below should have mic disabled\n\nit's not like you're going to say anything useful anyway, I dont need the ancient 3 player in my game asking me why im single pulling in some snarky sarcastic tone because he doesn't know u can connect pull even though that's been in the game for 10 fucking years\n\n
This [meme](http://onlinefanatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2013-Worlds-MonteCristo-Burn-on-DL1.png) transcends games.
You must be pretty sad, Sumail has already won so much. 
Wait.. lol what? 
You think so? Eg and VP overall Look Even. Navi has not been that Great and is comparable to COL. Optic hasnt been great, but other cis teams havent been either. For Sea, this is the First tournament where Fnatic look good. Mineski is pretty decent. I think Tnc is not as good as eg tho. And execration isnt that good. But im open for different opinions :) EDIT: sea might be a Bit stronger atm thinking about it. Still think CIS is even 
Others from CIS are better than All na teams apart from EG.
What exactly have I said that makes me such a bad fan?  The VP had a lot of answers for the TB.  \n\nVP also played really well, especially Noone on Tinker. But the draft was definitely not EG favored. 
?
Must be good seeing Cloud9 on cloud nine right?\n\n\nRight?
Sumail have accomplished much more than Cloud9.
Yeah I know hes trolling lol. But if he actually thinks he is a good troll it is really sad XD
Universe, no doubt
Nor as many missed lasthits
lmao, yea right
no dude you cant. smh. How do you even remotely think about this.\n\nmy message was: crit and misery are giving away their life to safe sumail, fear and rtz, but still he manage to like get picked off as much as them.\nhe's just not that pro anymore he used to be
Ever since 7.00, the first part doesn't happen to me anymore. It killed the spirit of the game.
In what world is game 3 draft EG favored?
Underrated comment
After EG LOST, you kept spamming draft was equal, and "Haters are gonna Hate". There are 5-6 top teams for some times now, why do you think there are two groups, one bashing eg fans others bashing the eg haters, i know both sides are equally obnoxious, but what makes you think is, why only EG (col to some extent), there are two groups at each other, it must have originated from some kind of cancers from their fans and themselves(EG team)(bragging the shit off) right?
Yeah let’s think about it from VP’s perspective. They have insane amount of teamfight and TB was shut down. All they have to do from that point is roam as 4/5 and look for fights or push towers. The only reason they would ever split up is to deal with split push from EG. It was impossible for EG to fight into VP and the only chance they had to come back was to make space by split pushing and stalling the game out. So yes you’re a 3k retard and should stop thinking you know how to play dota better than a pro player. You’re gonna delete this comment anyways like you do with every other stupid thing you comment on EG threads so what’s even the point of explaining basic dota to you 
Pushing a tower makes a ton of space... 
I knew as soon as Doom came out it was trouble, can't pick/ban a hero? Just delete them from game.
The drafts where equal. Idk whats wrong with saying that. \n\nAnd saying haters gonna hate on a comment about a guy who hates sumail with a passion seems fine by me.  \n\nNot once have a bragged.  Nor any other normal EG fan.
Even when I win I feel this way. But then I remember I'm not a little bitch and I queue up.
Wtf
This guy seems like a fucking piece of shit.
Oh god this is awful
holy shit my granny can play better than that
Too bad the viewing screens are off to the side so they can setup this monstrosity
lol a typical crybaby eg fanboy. must be sad to see rtz is as useless as EE
euro-ape confirmed. 
what is this circlejerk of who is the better mid lmao what has mid lane have to do with their win? VP outdrafted EG.  they made terrorblade's reflection became useless as fuck. Fear didn't even lost  the mid lane in the 1st place.
This is the fourth ESL major I visit. Fourth time went premium and all I can say Is, I'm really disappointed!!  Besides everything is written in polish and nearly no one is capable of speaking English, premium seating is a joke...after one game my neck already hurt and we had to change seats to the "normal" area. Sadly the goodie bag is not satisfying either. We had to wait for 70 minutes in the freezing cold to even get inside, cause the goodie bags were just being packed, nothing was ready. Missed the pre-show as well. Organisation is really bad, there are not even premium shops, we have to queue forever to get any food. (No difference for premium) Might be the last time I attend premium with the boys, we kinda feel scammed.\n\nPS: there is a reason the premium area is nearly empty! 
"we'll lose lategame against X'\n\n\nThe only time it is actually used when no one doing the said famine shit lmao. \n\n\n\nYour 2 core pick one side of the jungle and just expect to outfarm the other side at 40 mins. \n\nYeah good luck.

If you were in america you would be lucky to find the empty wallet alone. LOL

thank god, man, i was monkaS-ing , god bless u
Why not? If he found a wallet but wasn't sure it didn't belong to the guy making this thread, telling him the cc number would ensure that he wasn't pretending to be the guy who lost it. 
Had to wait in the cold because the bags were not ready. No seperate food area for premium ticket holders. Who designed that ugly t-shirt? Everything is in Polish, barely anyone understands English, huge problems with security - locking people out, not letting people through (because wtf is a premium ticket, right? you came through here? well you can't go back). Premium seats are the worst - basically neck breaking, also hard wooden chairs when free seats are padded? We can't have food or drinks in the premium area but the rest of the arena is ok? At least you turned off the blinding lights. This event is a complete opposite of Hamburg. 
Prepare for the "IM SUPPORT MAIN WORSHIP ME XDDDXXDDDD" Reddit downvote wave\n\nUs carry players are superior gods compared to the lowly support peasants. Buy us wards, slaves. You are all our slaves, your money is just for my vision and amusement. Ill be having fun, farmimg, getting kills, ans enjoying myself, while you beg for the scraps of my killstreak money. Youre lucky i dont turn my power against you pathetic weaklings. Get off Reddit and go ward my mid or gank safelane, whatever you 2k shitters do. Support ward bitches, know your place, under my boot. 
Probably when Fnatic have to play the best team in the world
There was catering on the far left side of the venue lamo, all you had to to is either look at one of 50 bigass posters with a map or ask some information officer which were clearly marked too, nevertheless I'm still amazed people still fall for ESL premium tickets after all the shit they got over the last events, the only thing it was useful was not having g to go outside to get to expo building which was 30secs away, do your fuxking research pal
Post about it on their facebook page Kappa
Dude are you retarded? Who carries or knows his CC numbers without his card?? If we say a name - sure thats the best way; date of expiry? Yeah may be you somehow remember when your card expires; but the fuckinh 16 digits number? Jesus...
No I am not, thanks for asking. I know mine and I'm sure I'm not the only one. 
Boy am I glad that Secret didn't push out that bottom lane, so that today we got to witness shit tier Envy clown fiesta instead of actual quality dota.
TI winners, 2 first place finishes, a second place finish, and soon to be a third place finish since TI. Yeah, they are still the best team in the world 
The vast majority of people are complete pieces of shit. You probably live in a rich western country if you think otherwise.
Because they won TI
yeah america is so trash LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!
fnatic deserved that win yesterday because secret is spacing out.  \nfnatic might really happy on their result this tournament.  \ntrashing some teams just for the karma is some low brainer mindset
No you don't :D You just realised what a stupid thing you said and you try to cover it by being a smart ass. At least you got it now..
You're right, 2 losses invalidates the last 12 months of dominance 
I mean I have no way to prove it to you, but I do. Not sure why you find that so unbelievable. Admittedly, I didn't realize your problem with that dude's joke was the idea of someone knowing their credit card number off-hand so I see what you're saying now but still.
Guys. Seriously. I can understand that you've might been on better events but please try to be understanding also.  \nI was here. And I have to say that apart from waiting in the line everything else was at least ok (except Premium zone).  \nHaving a lot of people in one place is a big challenge. Feed all of them, toilets, security, solving issues with drunktards... This was first Dota 2 Major in Poland and being from Poland I hope that this was not the last one.  \nBiggest issue for me was that hosts really didn't work with people in the arena. This was clearly stream focused event.
I'm premium ticket holder and I agree with everything you said here. \n\nI would like to add some minor things that really bugged me on top of that. Ater standing for 30min in cold in the queue, I wanted to leave my things in cloakroom and not only the told to pay for it, but pay for *each* thing I want to leave? wtf, I paid so much money for premium and they still rip off from me &gt;_&gt;\n\nAnd the food was the worst. We bought some popcorn and we couldn't enter the area, had to throw it away, because we didn't want to miss anything =.=\n\nAlso, there suppose to be "premium" signing session after semi finals, but it didn't happen, because of delays, so again I kinda felt robbed...
alright since you found it i can be a dick and be a dad and go like :" what kind of an unresponsible ass are you ? HOW DO YOU LOSE YOUR WALLET IN A FOREGIN COUNTRY ?? HOW ARE YOU ALIVE EVEN ???\n\n\nye but srsly why do you keep your papers on you and not in your bag in your hotel room
Yes it was and they have looked real good since. That's why they are still the best. If you disagree then who do you believe is the best?
serves me right for quickly glancing at flares (which i realized aren't even the same one)
Thanks for leaving the feedback.  I definitely can see where you are coming from and I'm sorry your experience was not positive.\n\nI am responsible for IEM events at ESL, but I am responding here because I was part of the team that designed the core fan experience in Katowice starting from the first event in 2013.  I do not aim to make excuses but I would like to provide context to how the experience evolved and how it was designed.\n\nI am also happy to meet with you and take the feedback in person, and show you around how everything is organized at the back end and show you areas where players compete, etc., to increase the value of your experience within my means.\n\nNow for your points:\n\n1) The queue space: I am not sure what you mean by massive empty space.  If you mean the area at the entrance of the expo, then you must have queued with the public queue and not the ticket holders queue.  I do not believe there is a large empty space past the ticket holders entrance other than the stadium concourse.\n\nThere's plenty of directional signage outside of the venue where the queues form with maps of the area and everything.  The ticketed entrance has two very large red banners pointing to it as well.  If you did not notice those, then maybe we did not do as good a job as we could have.\n\n2) The premium seating.\n\nThe system for premium seating is designed around the following things: \n\na) The primary value of the ticket is actually having a guarantee of catching the games, and it's designed about the insane demand at the event.  I am not saying it's ideal this way - I am explaining where the package originated from.  Starting from 2013 to 2017, you couldn't enter the arena for some of the games without a ticket.  It was full.\n\nb) You're free to sit wherever you want in the arena as it pleases you if you do not like your seat.  You come in early and you can pick any seat in the house (tbf the moment you move you might lose it, which was not a problem this week).\n\nBecause of how the bowl of the stadium is constructed (very open sections with the ability to move around quite freely + difficult to police), the most natural way to guarantee access to seating for ticket holders is floor seating.  The other option would be to post a dozen guards around 1-2 sectors and make people feel like they're sitting in a guarded cage, since that would be the only way to restrict access to ticketed seating.\n\nThis setup has been used for four years and if we had received strong feedback about it being bad, we would have changed it by now.  This includes comments about the visibility as well.  This is not to deny any of your points - all I am saying is that the majority of the people that previously bought tickets did not leave negative feedback.\n\n3) Food and drink.\n\nThere are food trucks posted within the premises where food is said to be decent to great.  Did you try that?  Premium only food stalls won't work in most sports venues in the world because of how food vendors work - they're entities that are independent from the organizers of the event and they need access to the maximum number of customers.\n\n4) The expo.\n\nIt's an expo in Poland and here I'll push back and say that you should expect that exhibitors at a show in Poland would set things up for a majority audience of Polish people.\n\n--\n\nTLDR: The design of the experience was built with the core value being "you are guaranteed to see all the matches you want" for an event that's totally packed with people.  We will evaluate the experience based on the feedback from this weekend, of course.\n\nFeel free to DM me and take me up on the offer to show you around on Sunday.
how come VG are suddenly better after winning 2 games?\n\nhttp://liquipedia.net/dota2/Dota_Pro_Circuit/Rankings\nLiquid still have 50% more DPC than them, remember that they are not even close of being challenged for a spot at TI, remember how team that stomp throughout the year choke at TI? 
The socialist approach.\n\nIIT: Triggered socialists.
Any up boats for visibility?\n\n(yes I know the real EE SAMA is in Poland at ESL One xD)
is your greatest concern in a foregin country, not being able to consume poison ? and another question, are you british ?\n\n
I don't know why this is so controversial. We have the DPC rankings now. TL are close to it but not quite. Although it depends on what your definition on "best in the world" is.\n\n&gt;http://liquipedia.net/dota2/Dota_Pro_Circuit/Rankings
&gt;EDIT: The wallet was found!!! We gucci! Thanks a ton for the support\n\ndelete the post then, that would be the honorable thing to do. You shouldn't reep the karma from tragedy.
Minors can enter bars but they are barred from alcoholic drinks. In an international event like this, you will have varying identifications from many countries and this causes problems with confirming age
I feel I could write my thoughts on the "godmode" ticket experience, which was definitely better, but I dont know how many people that would actually concern, given the price.\n\nBut I definitely agree with everything you said.
i've never been to poland but im sure no MOB resides in polish hotels that steal people's passport and demand payment,as that would be surreal
Makes no sense at all, every sport event in the world sell beer and minors are allowed to be there too.\n\nEvery restaurant, bar or any kind of entertainment venue sell alcohol and allow minor too.
Rofl
Not really, both very long back and forth games, and VG ultimately won because they pulled out their pocket strats which they are really good with (1st game super tanky underlord dk line up, 2nd game dp + gyro + batrider)
Hey if it makes you feel any better, it can’t be worse than watching the stream...
There's nothing like that. It's a shit experience for us premium holders. They don't give a fuck at all. 
Do you read with your asshole?
awful replay! \njust hide man
Maybe the NRA is right and we should be able to buy bazookas.

Man someone dropped a hammer on you when you were a newborn
I’d rather come out and say I’m a pedophile before I’d admit to owning that car 
Doesn't VP have less first place finishes than Liquid and VG have 0? How would doing well in one tournament where Liquid still place 3/4 make them the best?
LMAO\n\nget someone famous on twitter to RT so they get some recognition for their epic plates\n\n\nor just post a really good gameplay idea then watch who downvotes it to help EE
The Premium ticket cost 4 times the amount of the normal weekend ticket and was basically worse? Way to go ESL! 
The difference is that video games and their events exclusively cater to impressionable teens, not a 29 year old neckbeard who wants to drink beer and shout enemy positions all game
How are you allowed to own that license plate? Is that legal? You have a plate with "EE Sama"? My fucking god. [Disqualification](https://clips.twitch.tv/BreakableRamshackleDogeStrawBeary)
ESL One Manila was excellent and for me was completely worth the money I spent on it. Only criticism I had for it that I remember was that 1 - they should have made the autograph signing sessions go on time since some teams came late there\n\nand 2 - that they should have TVs in the autograph signing room. The games were literally nonstop, almost no time between games/series to even eat outside without missing almost an entire game.
I don't want to crap on VP because they played very well, but EG and Fantic both looked very... dull? today.
u mean before: admiralC after: Poggers
Imagine if newbee won ti7...
sports car must be really fast that OP wasn't able to take picture :D
4 losses*
Series, not games. Don't be dense 
I have seen a car with 322 license plate in Tokyo. Couldn't take pictures fast enough though.
Why dont you play support more? Im willing to bet the answer is the same reason supports dont automatically pool tangos.
Wtf is wrong with people?
Women tend to lose interest way quicker though.

/u/theflyingdj, /u/bslfromESL, /u/ESLJohannes\n\nHELLO?
You mean peckin' Aegis
\\&gt;Brutal, Savage, Rekt. Absolutely taken down.
Envy needs to stop drafting stupid picks. Venge carry is just so bad, I don't care what anyone says it's a terrible hero in the carry role. Envy may be a good shot caller, but that's about it, I doubt his abilities to play position 1. He gets carried by Abed and Universe in almost every game. But even in game two with a slightly better draft... I don't understand if you are going to draft so many strength heroes why not ban the timbersaw... 
It is.
Can he enter that area without premium ticket ? If he does than, why the hell did I bought premium ticket ? :D
More like "Oh god, Purge will say Miracle played the best Juggernaut game of all time just because of GPM"
That bfly was cringy as hell. He could have bought yasha + bkb and actually do something in teamfights...
Not even networth... It's just that he plays zero impact heroes. I've been following Envy since his NTH days, and this patch really does not do him any justice. And who the fuck are you to give me life advice about wealth? You don't even know who I am or what I do. 
To be fair you are complaining about things that you should have known beforehand if you read the information correctly. As I remember they usually give on the gift bag and you could have checked past events. Food information was also there and you know the layout of the floor plan &amp; seating. So again, you are complaining about things you should have known..
Are you kidding me? Zero impact really? Envy makes space everytime for abed because teams tend to trash abed early game because they know that he is the strongest player on fnatic. \n\n\nWith that envy creates space so abed can farm and get online. Hence envy picking early-mid heroes. If that's no impact then I don't know what else to say. \n\n\nAlso, are you denying my statement that hating someone would not get you rich? 
I accept and I understand your feedback. The core issue here is that Hamburg and Katowice are entirely different events in how they operate and the ticket name is the same, so why wouldn't you expect a similar experience?\n\nFrom that point of view you are totally right and it's a big learning for us.
Envy has had no impact on the last few games he's played. Wraith King and Venge in those games were just bad picks, sorry bub. \n\nI have no idea who the fuck you are and why you think you're qualified to make statements about peoples wealth. 
Any feedback is useful for sure. It may be unpleasant from time to time but it's needed. I know the ESL One crew is looking at what can be improved today. We always try to react to feedback as quickly as we can.
I'm not saying that you're poor or rich. I'm not assessing or making statements or your wealth. I'm just saying that hating other people will not benefit you of anything.\n\n\nAlso you just based it on the last two games they lost. How about when they win? Selective much?

Completely untrue, don't spout crap to support your agenda, it just makes you look like an ass
Plus we’re in poland, Im polish so no need to bash xx It does not change the fact that this major is an absolute dream come true for me
I wanna see EE win. 
Hello,\n\nthe process of getting in today should have been corrected so that it is better for you. Please let me know if that did not work out. \n\nSome of you asked about buying beer. However, this is an event without age restriction so under Polish law, selling alcohol is not allowed unfortunately. \n\nThere are now big screen tvs at the stage, which should help with the viewing experience. We will continue to monitor your feedback to see if the lights are now at a better level, the situation with echo should have been addressed yesterday. \n\nBest regards, \n\nJonas "bsl" Vikan, ESL Tournament Director \n 
The Joindota one, when you click through to their website, is so bad to use though.
10$ says the OP is female.\nAnother 10$ say she wants to be steam friends with the dude because he has a sweet car.
That's ESL for you, right there.
after each match the ppl leave their seats to grab some food or drinks just get another seat there should be no problem at all
I want to believEE
At that point he’d kill at least 3 with bkb+ult.
Strikingly stupid train of thought on your part. Wait for the lasso, wait until it ends, pop bkb and at least hit anyone instead of standing ib warlock's shit
You call them idiots yet you paid for an ESL event LUL
If liquid needed to get better I think they'd kick Matu

I'm pretty sure if I just finished my TI Grand Finals and checked my GPM I would get a little sad if it was under 700 as a carry or mid.
Nobody cares
Pls say you're in the AU region. Your wife and I could be friends. 
looks like it hit anyway but nice try
stop crying on Reddit and solve your problems instead? oh, you are 13 and don't know how
it didnt, that was caustic finale which he took damage from. why do you even type this when its right there in the clip itself for you to check. 
I thought we were on a train here
So they fuck up real attendees and stream viewers alike? GG ESL
Whats new? \n\nSell out trash company trying to maximize their profit. Who cares about the fans? All the care about is keeping money in the pocket.
Can we maybe get a picture of her watching Dota?
yeah fuck off
Mate just staunch one of these nerds for their seat. They never experienced confrontation in their life. I’d eat these kids for breakfast and steal their hats \n\nYou payed for that shit. Fuck their jobless asses
Incest 
Wtf. This is the shittiest settings for fans. Even GB 2 is much better for fans. 
because the question was not "were those chat logs fake" it was "whats created the most drama for you". Not my fault you're so fucking bad at google translate you can't read the video description\n\nanyway the actually helpful guy linked a tweet from 1437 confirming it was real
Have reported it, so someone should come over and fix it 
Im enjoying the event a lot so far tbh, food is pretty shit but what can you do, the rest is great so I'm willing to deal with that. Other ppl I know are enjoying it too. 
I mean this sucks, but don't project what they experienced on the rest of the live audience. Most of them are happy about the event.

It was really funny when I saw people with premium badges sitting next to us in the back of the arena... but at least the girls are really hot, yes I’m talking about you a lady from Red Bull stand with beautiful eyes!
sounds douchy, but that's what one needs to do. you paid for the seats, and now some guy is enjoying the view instead of you. this is not fair,you're not the welfare. confront, ask nice but firmly, if they don't go get the security involved. You're a customer and they are not, you should have the upper hand. if there is no security,well, I'm not saying that throwing them out yourself is the best idea but it's an option if nothing works.\n\nall things considered, going to reddit to complain won't solve this,sadly. it is everyone making aware of the issue,but most people here don't even watch the event because facebook streams are utter dogshit
Sectors J and L have arguably the best seats and there are still free spots. They should have opened the venue for early access earlier but it’s much smoother than yesterday.
I mean, he wants to remove the weakness of a skill that can clear waves at level 3..
They should make it so that Techies isn't relies on planting mines  \nHe 'tech-y' so he should have more tech like Clockwerk, Tinker, Timber, etc...
I just looked in to what happened here since this was obviously not how it was intended. \n\n1. Due to feedback on the previous day we opened the door to premium &amp; early access holders earlier (at 9) so they could already enter the overall venue instead of waiting in the cold\n2. The plan was to open Spodek to them at 10:00, followed by free ticket holders having doors opened at 10:15 \n3. Due to technical issues Spodek door opening needed to be moved by 15 minutes. \n\nAt this point in time there was a mess-up with the security who did not push back the free entrance by another 10 minutes and instead opened Spodek to everyone at the same time. \n\nI'm looking into it further to figure out where communication went wrong and how we don't repeat this. In the meantime I'm sorry for this happening
I watch stream, stream have ad, tournament organiser get money.
Don't give them ideas
hayhaahaahh
Who's "we"? I haven't used JoinDota or GG.net for a couple of years now. Liquipedia is my go to for everything \n\n#D I G I T A L S P O R T S.\n\nEdit: oh you mean the sidebar. My bad.
Looks like MODS got bought by JD $$$
ESL surpassed Shanghai shitshow EleGiggle
He got what he paid for. Stop undermining the charge back system with this petty bullshit. Chargebacks are for real scams, this is just a bad product.
If you’re creating new dota fans, they might want access to stuff like player signings next time
Techies has been reworked:\n\nCan now only plant one mine at a time. Techies digs themselves in to the ground until enemy triggers the mine or techies expire.\n\n\n
I was at all ESL events in Spodek since 2013 and every year they find a way to fuck up something. Last year the hall next to main arena was additionally locked so there was second queue you had to wait for to watch SC2, even if you bought a 3-day ticket .\n\nESL are experts at bullshiting at this point.
Fuck ESL.
no no no are you implying that ESL is the reason Dota exist?\n\nthat guy you are replying to said ESL event specifically.\n\nit's your fault for spending money for an ESL event
why is there a dusa in every second game?
Ud def be someone’s bitch in lockup

It does help me sleep knowing I don’t let people walk all over me. I work my ass off for the things I own. I’ll be dammed if ima let someone get a free pass.\nIt’s not being a douche it’s knowing your worth 
Running events is hard. That doesn't excuse them fucking up consecutively for several years. Spodek since 2013, it's 2018 already ffs.\n\nESL is just incompetent as a company, there's no more excuses for them.

This is not their first event in Spodek

Use common sense, good lord dude.\n\nUnless seats are assigned specifically, seats can't be stolen - what is this, grade school? 
You can afford pretty much everything if you got a good pr team (in case of EA you can afford it even if you don't :)) 
Insanely broken, Abed was playing like a God, should have won\n\nEdit: all the butthurt liquid fans downvoting me is hilarious xD
Balanced hero.
It was nice knowing you

ESL: Having a shitty Facebook experience? Come for our equally as shitty Live experience as well!
[UncleNox](https://clips.twitch.tv/BreakableRamshackleDogeStrawBeary) How is that balanced?
No matter how much u gank tb\n\nHe is broken throughout the stage of game.
They just need to make sunder COST MANA. WHY TEH FUCK IS IT FREE\n
miracle who made TB op his score is 6-0 but esl score is 7-9 \nmiracle the GOD 
Have barely any stuns on their team and this is what happens, liquid even first phase picked it so fnatic have no excuses
TB is actually balanced, people just hate saying Miracle is a god player and/or Liquid is god team.
I've defended esl alot with the fb stuff cuz frankly I've never had an issue casting Facebook into 1080p to my television at all the entire event. But with news of the venue also giving people issues, I can see valve maybe giving esl 1 or 2 less events next cycle. 
Always great to see redditors telling pros whether builds are correct or not and why they should go something else! Inspiring.
Perhaps, but the level of kiting they did at the last mega teamfight was really well played, if he only had 1 sunder, he most likely would have died at some point, then its easy clean up on the rest of the team
"the most balanced game"
Idk BF Tide or Tusk is better
This is kind of hilarious 
miracle who made TB op his score is 6-0 but esl score is 7-9 \nmiracle the GOD 
Interesting how &lt;100 people being just THIS good at the game causes an across the board nerf that affects millions of players.\n\nEdit: not saying it's wrong, it's the right thing to do obviously. What I mean is that a statistical outlier greatly affects the rest of the player base. 
if Liquid is god then how did Liquid get 3rd place?\n\nWeSmart
ppl are stupids they must know that 
ppl are stupids they must know that 
&gt; stupid*s*\n\nsure thing
fucking 2k's complaining about everything last week it is panda's ult now it is fucking tb idiots
Coz China is god of gods ^^^^^#NoKappa
For EE, every death is necessary. They dont call him fEEdternal Envy for nothing. :)
it doesnt change the fact that nerf still needed. Something being underlooked doesnt mean its not OP
shut the fuck up
shhh, don't try to spread logic and just enjoy the salt. 
classic leddit dude. if a good team is winning, its because they are playing the broken hero, the players' skill means nothing. i member old OG in their prime, they were the only team playing naga rad and won consistently. any team that picked naga during that time lost most of the time. but leddit with 11k balancing had to shit on the hero so much that she received retarded nerfs. this time its for TB. aside from miracle TB making the hero looking absolute broken, which team can win with a TB? even rtz manta dodged this major with this "broken" hero
While its a good result for Fnatic, the only real big win they had was against Secret. Mineski is still probably the best team in SEA but Fnatic and TNC are right behind them 
Didn't Secret beat TB?
aren't ESL tournaments know for this kind of shit ? they try to pick some big arena, but the whole organizing part is shitty. even the tournament format and everything is always shit. makes you wonder why they keep getting valve's money to organize more of these shitty tournaments
Next time copy something more interesting dude.
Sure! Mind control what a player!
fnashit looooooooool fangays
Because the ones complaining are idiots who only look at the hero, not at the shittons of things available to counter it.
Fnatic aint gonna be a top team with EE as the Carry.. Dj abed are solid kick pie lie die if ee cant kick himself just demote yourself to 5th position and  get that top mmr guys
again and again and again. FACT: the talent is broken!
&gt;Makes alot of sense actually and is the only consistent and fair way of judging whether a hero is op or not.\n\nNot really no. Proffesional players aren't a perfect representation of the entire playerbase. I don't know about asking every player but asking a more accurate representation of the playerbase would give better results. Base it off region, mmr, behaviour score, etc.\n\n[EDIT: Let me explain this first point a bit more. For example, if I wanted to find out what my country thought about it's government, I wouldn't go out on the street to do so. I woudln't go to the top &lt;100 net worth in the country either. I would want to find a more accurate representation of the country.\n\nI would look at income/region/housing/etc and I would ask a certain amount of people that I feel accurately represent the country. Very simply example here; If my country has 5 regions A-E, then I would ask maybe 20 people from each region. Of course there would be other variables, this was just to simplify it down to the very basics.\n\nI may have missed some things here, I am not a professional. If I have please correct me.]\n\nI am perfectly fine with balance as is. Just that I take issue with you saying it is the only "consistent and fair" way of judging whether a hero is OP or not.
what can you expect? im starting to believe this sub's average mmr is 2k 
what the fuck are you talking about
Next time copy something more interesting dude.
r/madlads 
lmao pure skills more like borefest 
Its a lvl 25 talent. Its supposed to be strong. Not everything that works in a game is broken.\n\nStun lock and burst him. Terrorblade had 0% winrate until yesterday when not played by Miracle.
leddit cant give credit to good players. they prefer taking it away and blame the hero instead. 
You mainly support right?
uhh, more like seats that they had paid for? like "you can sit in the front if you pay for tickets, you get early access to enter blabla" 
Shhh don't reason out to fanboys. See what he said? Abed was a God therefore he should've won. 
EE literally Tricked Ohaiyo into qualifying to a major WTF are you talking about
After their abysmal performance against OG(who themselves are not looking so hot right now), I don't think your statement holds true.
&gt;And how do u judge a hero based of region, mmr and behaviour score?? And every bracket is different if in 4k a hero has a 45%winrate but at 3k it has a 60% winrate how do u decide whether to nerf it or not?\n\nI am not a statistician so can't really answer that. My guess is that they take measure each variable individually, average them out and then put together the best solution based on the average. I may be wrong. If someone knows more about this than I do, pleas correct me.\n\n&gt;Metas are almost always defined by the pros scenes for pub games. \n\nDepends what meta you are talking about. Meta's vary depending on rank/region/gamemode/maybe even behaviour score.
Then I don't get it. You play core for your GPM not to win.
You're a fucking idiot.
How so?
Found the 2k redditor
its OPfrog now... ^pleasedontdownvoteme
Actually they bough sentry for mid so i farmed agh :)
Who is saying that? But nonetheless, TB's talent are broken rn. The hero itself is on the weaker side imo, but those talents really needs some rework. But let's face it, Fnatic is really a level below other tier 1 teams. 
Im 4k ty
yah so ee can kick pie lie die EE can move to pos 5.. if EE had no prob  kicking the long time fnatic i dont see why pie should stay
So if they stole it he can go to security, show that his seat was took by someone else and make them leave?
deso wouldve been completely useless. u pick up deso on brood to get a fast rosh and push fast twrs while blowing heroes up. liquid had a secured rosh, VG couldnt leave their base, had all outer towers down and matu had more than enough dmg to blow everything up. id personally get bloodthorn but its a known fact that matu doesnt like bloodthorn on brood. radiance helps farm and splitpush, again liquid didnt need that at all. whatever item in the game he wouldve bought, if they choose to push at the time they did they wouldve lost the game, oh and orchid solar chrest+bkb is MUCH more expensive than a bfly. they lost cuz they didnt wait for his bkb, not cuz he bought a butterfly.\ncould he have bought smth better? sure but he prolly wanted to play around a bit, with that much farm thats perfectly understandable. was the item the reason they lost? no, poor push timings and executions that are a captain/team call was the reason they lost. they prolly got overconfident and a bit arrogant because for months on end their early pushes have never been punished.
and TI iirc.
keep doing it, the same retarded people who spam 'UHH DURRR TB SO OP PLS NERF :('' doesnt have the right to tell you not to do something less stupid than what they spam
Nah, OSFrog pls add Reflection on enemy hero Sundered. Pls make level 20 Reflection cooldown reduction and no mana cost too.
Yu sir, is berry smart.
Kuroky Kappa
OP is saying "our seats" as in what he feels entitled to have due to having purchased a ticket - meaning seats they deem as the "better" seats. Ticket holders do not have assigned seats.\n\nThe sad thing is I was originally going to clarify this in my post but didn't think it'd need explaining. I have no idea how this isn't obvious to you.
&gt; Secret \n\n&gt;don't have anything to hide from eachother
Ty bro 
just nerf the sunder, idc, still gonna pick the 300 range
If I could wish anything for Fnatic and Envy it would surely be a little more **consistency** on the positive side. 
how was it beautiful? In those minutes Liquid did nothing and Fnatic could do nothing
im almost certain you could get inside at some point for free. i think it was free for the non main event games or something.\n\neitherway it's still a very solid setup to go and see for free.
If you were able to get in the arena did you try asking those idiots to get the hell out from your seats? If no why? If yes what did they say/how did they react?\n\nJust saying that I wouldn't be so forgiving to either parties involved. 
TB will get Windranger-ed.\n\nMiracle will get W33haa treatment.\n
Don't worry it gonna be balanced with the changes soon. Icefrog is just waiting for a bit more to hit the update button....
I feel that Mineski is too dependent on ice3 and Jabz to make their plays, plus they are pretty limited in their drafting because it seems that there are many heroes that Mushi and Nana couldn't play. While Fnatic has fEEd, overall their team skill ceiling is higher and more versatile.
orchid woud do nothing without a bkb. the point is that orchis+bkb or fly+bkb or any big item+bkb wins em the game, they choose not to wait for it.\ni agree that orcgid wouldve been better but the butterfly isnt the reason they lost
Clearly I don't read! That's not efficient.\n\n\n^^or ^^effective.
The butthurt in this comment is amazing
Guess its what goes around comes around for EE.\n\nFelt bad for Abed though, he was magnificent on that series. Its just that, Fnatic draft was not on par with Liquid's. Kuro played the third draft so well.
Nyx? Doesn't Riki become visible while TPing?
Sorry to hear that. I am surprised since we got to the arena at 10:43 and had no problem finding decent seats. 
Balanced Hero, broken Talent.
They luckily got top4 lol
You lack life
More like, got carried
still can't win a major LUL
pls stop this bs. next thing you say VG luckily beat Liquid...twice!
&gt; For the next three majors, we will not be seeing EE\n\n
no
Hmm, so terrorblade doesn't deserve a sunder nerf?
Yes
You're wrong\n\nWhen it comes to a techies' game, nobody wins . And if you add a Tinker at the enemy team, then everybody loses
without naga VG is nothing but garbage team. Yes, I'm salty Liquid fan who dont understand why Kuro so cocky and had decided not to ban Naga ytd.
Man what the fuck is this. You guys are all shitting on VG after one game?  I know reddit is retard but this is beyond retard
I thought your comment would end with ESL=Equally Shitty Live.
Cringe. Sheever with stupid questions. \n\nCan players and teams just tell talent to fuck off during the series so that they are not distracted?\n\nNot to mention stupid cameramen capturing ArtStyle's notebook, KuroKy's bag, gh nostrils...\n\nRespect their personal space, fuckers! Grow up
This ESL sucks thing has become a meme. And while i do agree that ESL sucks i still think people are whining a bit too much. These things happen at every concert/music festival, it's just these pimpled dota players that think this type of screw up is worth posting about.
ESL OMEGALUL\n\ni mean.. they tried their best smileyface, dont be so harsh on them smileyface
Anyone else having problem with switching tabs on chrome while watching the stream? Mine keeps freezing everytime I go to another tab, forcing me to reload it or be several minutes behind. \n\nNo, I don't want to watch the entire draft, I want to listen to it while doing other things.. Garbage stream 
People like you are the reason "satan' can continue to be successful.. Maybe stop supporting shit companies like ESL and things can change in the future. \n\nYou deserve everything that happened to you this event and I'm glad you get no compensation. Hopefully smarter people won't buy more ESL tickets after reading this thread.
Poor butthurt liquid fanboy :(
/u/Islamiyyah with another herald analysis. 
Jesus Christ are you retarded or what?\n\n Do you even have any facts or are you just spewing bullshit based on a salty OP? \n\nThere are **no** predetermined seats.\n\n **All** seats are free and equal. \n\nOP's ticket was supposed to let him enter the arena earlier than those that didn't pay so that he could sit down before them but he doesn't actually own a designated seat so if for whatever reason he's unable to get one, guess what? Tough luck you were never entitled to one. \n\nYou pay for the early access, the seat is just  a byproduct of it.
Why the fuck does ESL keep popping up a camera of the audience shaking noise makers? Who the fuck cares?
rofl, i think you're the idiot one here. how are you even gonna bring down TB if you're only jumping him with 1 hero? \n\nokay, initiator jumps in then what? you'll have to have your other cores to jump in as well to deliver the damage.\n\n"you really believe all 5 hero from opposite team at high enough hp to pull off a sunder?". he doesn't need 5 ENEMY heroes at high enough hp he can easily sunder his own teammates, he can easly sunder his own illusion.\n\n
So this is why they left the signing session with people still left in the queue :(
Even After game with fnatic they still disrespect them! \nMah nigas 
Singsing is entertaining, but hot damn I wish he wouldn't use edge-pan for observing. Just turn on smoothdrag and use mouse3
you mean bulldog? OpieOP
monkaGIGA 
Because fck pineapples
my ear is bleeding hearing nahaz blabing about stats. dude he argued with blitz like he know better about the game while blitz has more  knowledge that him for sure (from being longer in the scene, be around pro player, coaching, becoming pro (at some point Keepo) and stuff)
bermapan
He and Bulldog are why I watched it on facebook. If you're fans I understand the appeal, but if you're a random person they are SUPER annoying (friends included).\n\nS/O to the subs downvoting me. They insulted EE for 15 min straight and they don't even play pro. I don't even like EE, but come on.
wats nahaz mmr?
Really? I'm the complete opposite, cannot stand sings voice.
dead meme
and still manages to talk blatantly incompetent shit all the time and get caught in arguments/statements where he is miles out of his depth,  which is an achievement in itself, i guess.
Cringy acting, i giggle but i still hate it.
Pizza spirit confirmed next hero
The classic "I'm too Dota smart to enjoy people yelling about abilities" 
More like “No_Cholesterol_Control”
well it explained a lot but didn't even explain how and pizza party. It literally skipped over the pizza part.Most of us know but for the Out of loop people which will be targeted audience it still doesnt explain why pizza party.
Not to say anything against Na’Vi or Lil but how many points have they earned since they picked him up. So I would think that even if that record isn’t relevant anymore they haven’t really done much else since picking Lil up. 
I COULDNT WATCH IT. ITS CONSTANTLY BUFFERING. CANT ESL DO ANYTHING RIGHT?
But the joke was that Kuro was getting kicked... are you a little slow?
Looks like Lil is giving NaVi a free TI ticket. Sure he deserves it but it seems like a bad system.
They should change it so he cant attack while phased. This stuff is absurd.
He is never busy when it comes to Dota2 and reporting major events or patch notes. Something happend, hes facebook also didnt get updated for more than 3 days. 
Taking a piece of data out of context and calling it dumb works for about everything.\n\nThe downside of having circuit points and full transparency is that it opens the way for teams to try manipulate the rankings. That's just how it is. Most of the top 8 deserve to be there, and everyone earned their keep. The system is fair. There is almost nothing wrong with the lil points either. His points were earned. It did not appear magically. The road to ti is a long way away and the roster has been locked. If any team hopes to buy players and earn 0 points in the upcoming 4months where 65% of the dpc points are to be given out, it's nigh impossible. 
ya this is the dumbest part
I don't even own a Twitter account and i check your Twitter almost daily. You're the best!
Yeah he got what was coming. He even had the balls to call out Icefrog and say "but mr frog told me to 'be myself'" as if thats an excuse. \n\nI remember way back in 2010 or something for one of the first Starcraft 2 tournaments he had the fucking balls to ask flirt with a man's wife on stage on air, and ask her out jokingly before introducing TLO vs Idra when the 7 marine rax was used the first time in pro play. The couple of course played along but that was not funny and James back then looked hella sleezy.\n\nLike seriously what kind of esports tournament host does that shit? 
The number of kills, duration and lack of buildings falling down screams 1k mmr. Also bonus octarine core on shaman.
It doesnt take a genius to realize why oracle is a good counter to ds
do you REALLY need boots though if you are starving for slots.  everytime i see him he's just jumping and blinking around.
fck, I loled.
But if other teams can't surpass those points of just that one player who was brought in (as people say) do they really deserve a spot at TI?\n\nMaybe Navi with Lil is in the correct spot on the rankings after all.
Yeah. But they didn't celibate with pizza. It was only 2 members and was blown out of proportion. It was almost 6 min video with 15 sec of inaccurate pizza information.
Did you not see the mjolnir procs doing all the damage?
He didn't leave. he was swapped... and you know, as far as Rodjer's pro dota career is concerned, I think you're gonna start with "-ProDota Gaming" there
‘Ohhhh my goooooooood!’ \n\n
Who is this dude? I thought he was a caster?
it still takes a couple seconds to leave the coil. By that time they are already low enough to get killed from dream coil or be almost dead enough to just die anyways
Yeah those are stupid too. Except DP. Omnislash is too old to change ever but I don't get why they added Tricks of the trade.
That doesn't mean that he can't be good at the game
So you prefer that Gachigasm Clap shit. no my friend, you dont want that shit.
somehow, my brain picked up this\n\n" Why go damage when you can go even more evasive and BUSTY with xxx / shivas (beer) / chixs? Which you can afford with 420 gpm "
&gt;If a player from the #2 team is kicked in favor of a player from #1 team and the kicked dude has to join a 12th ranked team where all his well earned points become meaningless\n\nYou start with an "if" and never end up at a "then".\n\n**IF** a player from a #2 team ends up on a #12 team where all his points became meaningless, *then* what? That seems reasonable to me, especially in a game where we see team composition mean so much more than individual skill. Na'Vi at 315 seems reasonable, if Lil is a reasonable boon them, then that 315 should climb.
who is older, kotl or shaman?
You know why females beg me for dick? It's because I show them these graphs.
How is that not broken....
stfu noob dog.
Sing is different
I'm with you, either OPFrog or Osfrog, not the mixed case crap he put lol\n\nedit: i had one fucking job
See this is why we need a logical language folks lojban for lyfe
Nobody cares btw and she sounds like a chick, so meh
One of my favorites.
The much better alternative is to count all five player's points.
You guys must have rly bad eyesight. I was sitting really far up and still would see every ban in the game, without checking on stream, so did 2 of my friends
The alternative is to count all 5 players.
Can I make a joke about .. "Allahu Akbar" here? no? ok sorry bye.
Right click animation is not a reason. in fact puck's right click animation is much better than qop's. Qop has a large backswing btw. \n\nBuilt in blink vs illusory orb and phase shift.. it's about equal. Dude the puck and qop matchup is a classic one, they are about equal in terms of right click. Puck might currently be better played as an evasive hero, but it's definitely not unthinkable to build it as a right click. Because it's not popular does not mean it does not work... My post is purely theoratical as well, I'm not like saying puck right click should be the proper way to play the hero, i'm just saying it could be pretty viable as puck does have the tools to do it.
The best one.
ofc he wouldnt want to make a meme which puts even worse reputition on him
Synergize or not depends on how you build puck. If you build her as carry dd then it synergize very well. Very hard to kill with lots of mobility damage dealer while dealing a lot of magic damage as well? Why not!
passes my "kill score" check. pretty good
A better attack animation is 1 of the worst reasons to give. Lina when played as a core goes right click pretty often, and her attack animation might be the worst shit ever. But a good skillset makes it viable, so that point is invalid. \n\nWhy does puck need spell lifesteal, if it has rapid fire dreamcoil? They don't fit the same purpose, but each have an argument going for them. 420gpm is probably the main reason why we don't see pucks going down this route, it's just simply too good.  But it's not impossible to think that it would be viable one day. \n\nTheir other talents are evenly matched as well 40% as+ 25damage vs +50damage +5 armour is about equal in terms of building as a right clicker.  \n
Who is wykhrm reddy ? No one knows him and it's a request pls don't post such things on reddit ...He's not a pro player or Caster or analyst? Is he ? Then why put his name here..Maybe he's just an attention seeker and a no name in dota community ...Pls Don't make threads like this 
Jokes on you, 3k is actually cancer as well.\n\nRIP
wait why do people go to an event live if you have to watch it on a screen that's like 500 feet away\n\nfrom this perspective, your better off just staying home unless you like the crowd
Wait, you have friends? 
I would love number of attacks during stun/cc (special case would be disruptor/clock's mini arena)\n\nThis will measure good carries , specially if you want to check on a shit carry who attacks only once during a 4 second stun
Think about it the otherway around: If the bottom 8 teams get paid, the top 8 teams get way less. And they had to do a lot to do so. But bottom 8 has done not that much. Last place may have never won a game. And for 0 wins you should be awarded with a bounty? Idk, seems a bit unfair to top8 places. But I agree that they should not get nothing. Maybe we need a system that not only rewards placesment but also won games/serieses. 
Definitely not the UI designer of Dota 2
I think they should use the old system and the mean system but uses a percentage and add them up. Maybe 60%(old system) + 40%(mean system) for more fairness + if they want to keep the old system. 
Skadaddy!
They came for csgo not for dota
&gt;In the current form when a player is kicked he can carry his "worth" to the new team he joins while the core players of that org doesn't lose out also. But if you strip that off, the kicked player is being punished unfairly while the org suffers no point reduction.\n\nThe org already doesn't suffer a point reduction, and if we take the VP&lt;&gt;Na'Vi swap as an example, in avoiding "unfairness" to 1 person (Lil), you've inflicted unfairness on 25 people (Mineski, OG, EG, Fnatic and LGD), who deserve to be above Na'Vi and thus 1 rank higher rather than below them.\n\nThat said, I don't think most people (*most* people) would be kicked "unfairly". If a top team decides to kick someone *despite* their success, there are probably irreconcilable differences.\n\n&gt;You can argue for team chemistry but top teams being one major win away from a TI just before the roster lock invite wouldn't care kicking a player for a better one.\n\nThis is another mess of a sentence, but from what i can interpret of it, there's nothing stopping orgs from doing this now, is there?\n\nIn fact, putting aside the question of where teams will just "find" a better player, I'd say the current situation encourages that more than the proposed solution, because right now you can kick someone for a better player and that better player's DPC points might push you into the top-8.
Talents were a mistake this is NOT dota anymore
and now both ditya ra and sonneiko is gone ... and na'vi is still in the bottom\n\nis it possible that dendi is the problem??? but that isn't possible right? because dendi is best mid. 
Wait what how the fuck do you even throw that game?
Considering that none Dytia Ra and Sonneiko doesn't even exist on scene, it seems like they were problem in some way.\n\nYou don't have to be best or worst in world for you to recognize if team chemistry exist or not, or if someone is dick or not. You do that on daily levels.\n\nFor example I think you are dick and couldn't form team with you, and I'm 3k scrub, but seeing that you are dick it was obvious to me. I don't have to win TI to notice it.
4k is 100% the worst bracket to play in, brace yourself. 5k onwards is much better.
fan of the streamer or the hero or the game in general?
Where I said that the game should never change? Of course it should but talents are often bullshit(especially the 25 ones).
If it's a 1v5 scenario like this yes, if not he does have teammates to fuck u in the 5seconds. 
the only 2 brackets that are good are 3k and 5.5k. in 3.5k's pool, its a place where smurf or account booster born. you winning the game or not solely based on which team has more account booster. from 4k to 5.2k is another shit hole where every1 thinks they are rtz and do something shtis and then acting arrogant everywhere. however in 5.5k onwards people are humble and know that they are not good as we sometimes get paired with pro players and get shit on for tons of times. So people are bearable with each other's mistake and have continuous communication throughout the game.
"God of autism"
fuckoing hell i knew it looked funny
This is harsh but we'll just see the result of this kind of prize distribution. It seems that Valve is conducting some kind of experiment here pertaining to participating teams' commitment to win and make it at least top 8... or they just otherwise wasted time and money of participating on that tournament. Might bring out the best of teams'  capabilities or we might see less motivated teams in future  qualifiers for these kinds of tournaments with this kind of prize distribution.
Who cares about wyk and why
Holy shit i think i found grandgrant
Am I wrong or is it so that they can't get an invite to TI since they changed their roster after the lock?\n
Technically the cool down does decrease.\n\nThe time the item is usable again after the beginning of the activation decreases by a second per charge used on the bkb.. OSFrog
Anyone that finds that funny is 100% a virgin.
im sure theyre still getting paid

Apparently he asked to leave, yes.
I mean...they aren't at the bottom...they were doing really well...so you're talking shit.
calling dinner a party.. literally the biggest lie of my fucking life
How do you even throw as Puck? The hero is literally unkillable!
Posting ultra kills now, sad, good throw Henry my boy, now go and pick the lady some poppys
But how? They're all dead and some of them appear to have bought back previously, I'm genuinely baffled
You kids are pathetic with understanding how advertising works...
You must be playing different 3k then. It's all the same, I've dropped 800mmr in the past weeks, the games are so incredibly shit I'm kinda forcing myself to queue for ranked games right now. The amount of mouth breathing feeders is astonishing. 
Downvoted for invisibility so that EE-sama can use it later
you just said the problem yourself\nand its not chemistry either i am not even talking about that
that's my problem about him\ni've been a fan since his run in KS.int and all the other fans are delusional enough to think that he is still the guy that carried na'vi in TI1 
I don't think that many watched it on the official stream. It's hard when it start lagging after 5 seconds.
ditya ra is in a new team in EU.. and OG is destroying everyone in the regional qualifiers even w33 or saksa can't get out\nand sonneiko is inactive\n\nand i'm not talking about chemistry
Thanks for the fast reply mate.
This guy is a shit caster and I am disappointed that he received an opportunity for exposure from ESLs fuckup\n\nChange my mind
Fuck EE. He's a serial killer in the making.
i though they all hated each other ..
Seems fine to me. If you can't get out of the groups, you don't deserve shit. Go practice and try to get better.
And the viewers on live.esl-one.com and the ones who watched through VLC.
? it stuns for .5 seconds you dont think it takes at least 1.5 seconds to get out of the coil especially if you are in the center? Not to mention you couldn't know that the enemy got divine daedalus and would go in like that. hindsight is 20/20 but if you think you would have left that dream coil the moment you got stunned then you are either 1 of the best players or extremely arrogant and overvalue how good you are. Half the time you dont even leave the dream coil because a 3 second stun is usually worse than staying in it.
Well it's fun but since sf was invis and void was not aware, it could have made him time walk away and fail the gank. Cool mechanic to know about but in this situation it was not well used.
Kuro just standin there. Imagine that today. These dota pros changed so much. They are Superstars today, they need secruity and stuff...\nBack then they were normal humans to us.\nBack then they where Idols allrdy but only in playstyle. Today they have to fullfill so many diffrent roles.\nFlashbacks of DGC's Enigma, when Nirvana still was a team. \nKuro and fans just wanted to enjoy some good old dotes. That word did not even existed in 2011:D              \nToday there is so much bullshit and whining about Dota dying etc. Just fucking enjoy the game we all love.\nThanks for the memoriez.
Nice argument you moron. Those teams already paid to get and live there. If they will go 0-3, fuck off then, you don't deserve any money. Go cry to your whore mom retarded kid.
No one questioning how they will part that prize? 1/5 each player?
No, there *are.
4th greatest
Sorry, but who the fook is that guy?
i breathe, i have dota installed, give me money
joinDota event page shows small payments for 9-16 placements.\n\nhttps://www.joindota.com/en/coverages/17596-esl-one-katowice-2018
he was just a tard in a finstack back then.. xd
It was Merlini IIRC. Can't remember which hero was it with.\n\nEdit: My bad.
thats karma, navi killed so many teams by poaching players, serves them well. Im still salty about them taking funn1k from empire.
found the incel.
 Yup ...I am getting down voted cus I spoke the truth ..and how does this negative karma thing affect me anyway ? Lol ...I am not like all of u n0 lifers who sit on reddit all day and have no life ;) ..Even wykrm is like that ..
why didn't void chrono right away?
for selemene *xyclopz voice*
I think he is just stupid
cmonBruh
I .... think you .... should.... have a few more..... ellipses.... in your comment....
Why so serious? Are you a little slow?
So you were an Oracle spammer that didn't use his basic dispel(IMO one of the main reasons to even pick a hero to begin with)?
more viable actually, courier shield is better than haste
You could probably pull off a better combo with magnus without dispelling a key damaging ability of DS. Magnus pulls people close, you start to channel the Q on Oracle and boom, chain CC
I meant using it on teammates to purge various debuffs. Oracle is great against heroes like BH/Slardar/any hero with a silence because he has a basic dispel on a short CD. 
Yeah, I do recall something like that, and it does require an insane presence of mind to do that(one of those seemingly-obvious plays that most people would never do). 
/r/dota2smut is garbage. Zero quality. 
He had 2 seconds to decide what to do and he chose to walk directly under the ulting SF 
Yes they're good but do your replies have to be so cringy?
Did I say I had a problem? Am I not allowed to ask a question on a discussion board?
so if the timing is correct..shouldn't this spell be op?\n\nfor hero's like sf qop and other blinky bois?
did it with ebola once 
Your mother , punk
yea? you gonna timewalk while rooted? timewalk all the way to 2017 when you still could do that
Then he misses, overshoots the target and gets rooted under the tower.
2k nightmares.
This is reddit, not readdit. Go back to the library, nerd!
Does it not root? I have no idea.
He would probably just stand there then.
Hell yeah, dude. DEATH INCARNATE
you can also pre-cast it to axe before he calls for follow up cc\n
?
The jakiro remodel we need.
3 heads are better than 2
I don't get it?\n\n**I am on Laptop - Windows 10 - i7 2.4 GHz, 8 GB RAM , 2GB 840m** \n\nAnyways, can anyone tell me what's the best way I can increase performance of Dota2?\n\nI use -high and have tried different versions of direct x and even vulkan. \n\nIt shows sometimes high fps, but they are not actually high fps, it lags and it is not smooth, it jitters, not really lag.\n\nBut its so annoying!\n\nWhen i turn v sync on, it is slightly smooth but for the cost of high fps reduction.\n\nAnyone with knowledge care to guide me?
macOS HAHAHAHA
Games on macOS? First world problems, valve lul
No TB? I give it 5/10
this set is great
theyre using dota2 as a test platform for some rendering apis. unfortunately less than 1.5% of steam users are on mac, so almost nobody really cares about this shit.\n\ntheres really no way to increase dota2's performance. source2 runs like crap and the only solution is to buy better hardware or play another game.
looks a bit like a star destroyer
true, there are so many good sets that valve won't add because they want to market it as an ultra rare or some shit 
bazelgeuse is that you?
How is it that all the sets trying to mimic wc3 models of heroes look the coolest? \n\nTerrorblade, antimage, now this
Does... does that happen?
Yeah valve have given up on just throwing decent sets on the market. Since chests or drops don't exist its all about buying a 30 dollar bundle. Everything needs to be super mega ultra epic immortal.
WAS THAT ICHINOSE'S THEME WHEN CLOCKDAD DIED?! AYAYA Clap
Add more texture highlights and flared particle effects, and voila. That instantly becomes Arcana tier. \n\nAll in all, this set is amazingly well done. Props to the creator/s. Take my up-vote, sir. 
Lol the post got so many dislikes from HL3 fangays
Ice head should be more goat like to fit with the Chimera theme.  Very nice set though.
macOS What's that.
use -dx11 -nod9ex in launch options. disable antialiasing in options. Nvidia cards run better on dx11 than on dx 9
my screen flickers when on vulkan and Nvidia wont fix it.
The artist could have made the two tails snake heads instead. The ice head should be a goat head not dragon.
I have no idea why people find these videos entertaining
Holy shit that looks fire 
What was the last time Valve added the set I really liked and it wasnt an ultra rare? :thinking:
i saw tilting and flaming my teammates a lot earlier, Then i realized positivity goes long way and helps hold the team together. The 6 month ban message just made me think that maybe i am the problem too that i whine about. So to be change, you have to be change.
This is the PR/Marketing dude thing to do, or manage.\n\nBut some org are soo busy chasing amazing sponsors, that they forget about free views and community.
I only do it on my smurfing account lolol I have good behavior score on my main where I care more about winning than ego
Holy crap. I dig this set. The Chimera set we deserve. \n\nHope it gets in-game, and Jakiro's backswing castpoints reduced.
G L A N C E V A L U E\n\n(The set is really cool btw)
Not that smartass redittors care about their jokes being based on reality.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
Because nostalgia
Flaming is ruining games on purpose. "Tilting" is ruining games on purpose.\n "I didnt grief" "I flammed and titled" pick one
Well shouldn't be dying for the runes now should we? :)
What do you mean? He perfectly timed the ult. He knew he would walk to the secret shop. If you can’t see he even cancelled the ult, to time it perfectly
How do you get that? You said you flamed and fed. I said i was glad you finally stopped ruining games on purpose, but that it's sad it took a fake threat of a ban to get you to stop. You then tried to claim you didn't feed or flame (despite you saying you flamed and fed)\n\nHow am I finding "Negativity in even most positive things" flammined and feeding is not a positive thing. 
your life is my dream , wao i feel dead now .
First
Playing Games on Mac, WutfFace.
Upvoted because you should really be proud of yourself mate! Wp
&gt;Being dead when 00:00 Bounty rune is picked up does not grant the gold to you\n\nas it shouldn't.
If nobody flamed, we'd have support Zeuses that didn't get core nuking jungle camps all the way up to 4k MMR.\n\nDon't enable bad behaviour. There's a right way and a wrong way to flame/criticize, obviously, but if you don't make an effort to improve the community you play in, why are you here in the first place?
This could end up spoiling though if you see " Team X vs Team Y FINALS MUST WATCH". Then you know which teams won there respective games 
&gt; There***'s*** like 50 of them\n\nThere *are
next best thing would be going to the Tab labeled as WATCH and then Replay, here shows you the most downloaded replays of the previous events, comes pretty close to what u're looking for, then ofc u can swoop over to NoobFromUA and watch the shit\n\n\nhope this helps
what kind of dota meme doesnt have Syndren \n\ndownvoted for inaccuracy
Dude i flame like crazy  and always between normal and C what was your behavior score did you feed intantional , abandoning games and stuffs ? how many reports :D
Just because you now don't act toxic anymore because of the ban message, it doesn't mean that you have really reformed yourself xD\nBut at least you have turned into an Alch spammer now.
You said you feed bud. "Tilting"
Yea, those racists kids spamming all day long, every retarded moron miss twitch chat.
I feel like this is probably intended.
Good, i don't want crappy placements getting money because they managed to win one series.\n\n
Of course not.\n\n"There's &lt;plural noun&gt;" is nearly on the same level as "should of".
What do you mean should of? I think you meant "should have."
Enjoy your ban.
play unranked , and suport 
Is there groups for this?
The only way to improve your score period is to 5 stack and grind turbo.\n\nI had a D, summary pops, 5 reports 40 commends, dropped to F
So are you 5.2 or 4.2.\n\nEdit; hmm, i think you used to be 5.2, but dropped to as low as 4.5 hmm?
I like it. Otherwise an invite means just gifting money.
i hate AA pickers man. Makes Going high ground so tough. Also, that move speed increase via ice vortex is so fucking stupid.\nI am recently spamming Jugg, so, I hate AA  LIKE FUCKING ANYTHING. cOUNTERS MY WHOLE FUCKING GAME PLAN, DUDE. REMOVE THIS HERO FFS!!!!!!!
idk,  just ask some friends or on a local chat\n\ni mean if you do a push strat game is over at 5 minutes.
My friends and I report pretty much report any Huskar we play against, win or lose: just bc the way they always seem to pick him is so scummy
damn i wish they added the do yu kno de wey reference here with rocket flare and hookshot.\n\nfunny if clock tps in and asks if they kno de wey then midhookshot i know de wey\n\np.s. also if near a pudge clock asks do you kno de wey my butcher??
For your information behaviour score is internally a number from 1-1000 categorised into letters. A report is -400 behaviour score, a commend is +100 behaviour score and an abandon is -1000 behaviour score. So you need commends. \n\nAs for the finding game part, it took me 3 weeks of was 'playing' (including queues) 5 hours each day to get from F to normal. 
i can help u maybe if u fund 3 more Kappa\n
well, i don't think that's OP or anything anyway. that's +10G to each which isnt worth much. Might add an interesting mechanic too\n\nEdit: ok i just considered 1 rune in there. It's +20 for 2 runes. I don't think you can contest 3 runes after losing one teammate though
You hired a booster to save yourself. Win streaks means less reports and more commends. Thats how you got out. Surprised you even posted this. Such huge win streaks are pretty rare in ranked, and you got multiple of them (both showing in the 2 different pics) which start right after your ban imminent warning.\n\n

There are different types of 'toxic', on one hand i get a bit angry at my so called support silencer rushing aghs and dying withing a minute of respawning every time (not on purpose they're just so bad, how on earth is he in my game?) but I will never just go into a game and just start having a go at people for no reason and I'm defo not gonna rage bb or feed chicken. There's a difference between being justifiably annoyed and being truly toxic. Maybe I shouldn't get annoyed but in all honesty I don't get how my manner is going to make a difference in that situation as they're already feeding and losing us the game, they're not going to suddenly be able to play the game if I'm nice and I shouldn't have to teach someone to play or tell them what to do in my ranked matches and if that's whats expected then matchmaking is just broken.
I had a D\n\n\nHow does it feel to be trans? xD
Being 2k doesnt mean you have brain damage. 
no chat 1/10
Message the Other_valve guy. He can look into it.
Veil isnt that good, i found a lot more sucess runing kaya with he +10% spell amp and then going atos and + hp regen talent into either dagon or euls.
You could win both runes and lose a teammate in the process 
people still play ranked?
can u link your dotabuff? want to see your alch builds\n
I found totally amazing that the best dota player alive is from a inconsequential country like Jordan. It's in the Middle East. You think war. You think misery. But no, just a boy plays some dotes\n\nAlso, that's the first time I hear he speaking casually, he's like a retarded dota player. That awesome too 
and? i don't get how that's any different with what i said with the edit 1hr ago
I meant getting the enemy's runes. You could get 4 runes and lose a teammate or 2 in the process

that's something you can't time though
Yeah, i meant like a random chance to happen, not abusable every game
kill yourself
But but but reddit told me that the report system was a fair system that worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Palestine? Safe? [Wut](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/palestine.html)\n\nI don't want to really discuss which country is better or what you consider "normal". Let's just agree that being neighbor with a country that was the most famous war zone in the past decades can't be the safest place on Earth \n\n\n\n
30%+ Cancer fiend pickrate
If you hit all your ults in the fitting moments im sure it can work but you are clearly playing from behind and need a strong team
That would be stupid, you could give your mid Invoker 400 extra gold toward a midas or a pos 1 400 gold toward their Ring of Health super early to allow both supports to roam.\n\nFuck that.
What the fuck? \n\nYes, you did\n\nUnless you mean saying "safest in the region" doesn't mean it's safe at all. Which is even more retarded\n
It could very well be that he got reported by 3+4 people in the 2 games he lost
I suggest moving out from that fucking continent
HYPERDANSGAME EXPLAIN ?

This is bad for tier 2/3 team who hardly has good sponsors... And remember, PGL doesn't pay for flight and accommodations. \n\nTier 2/3 team need all the money they can get in order to sustain. If more organizer spread the reward like this, the competitive scene will be stale imo. No more Ad Finem story. \n\nAfter all this is not a qualifier anymore, it's the competition, the tournament. \n\n
OP, Valve obviously want fewer and fewer people playing ther game. And it’s working. 
40gpm?
One of the best players?Try "the best".
I have been to F behavior score, you need to take commends and not be reported for your behavior score to increase. I only played position 5 when i was in F and after the game i told my team to swap commends. Some commended me anyway cause i played support. Thats how i got back to normal behavior score
Create a surf account and buy a new cellphone SIM (and throw away after registration) perhaps?
Step up your game, Vega. Struggling against open qualifier stack, embarrassing. I mean they called FlytoMoon for god sake which is just terrible instead of FlyMeToTheMoon which is much better.
80
Bruh, fnatic vs liquid game 2 was cleaely the highlight of the major
was she actually pretty or not
are you new to esports ? FlyToMoon is so much better. Its a team name.
Yeah, if you are not top 8 go ask your mom for money or find a real job
Yea,  they pay bootcamp though 
if you want points/money, win your games. its that easy
Write مارون in google translate and listen to it.. it sound more like maroon
Where is the fun in playing support?
Exactly the same situation here. Also Ancient rank, playing on Aus servers. A few days of random NBN upgrades = three abandons. I am no longer able to find any game (not even turbo). Have we established that the only solution is partying? Does my score get averaged out by my teammates, or will we just be 5 guys with no game?
Here is the scenario. You get the message and decide to better yourself. You have one bad game where you are being clearly out played in your lane (happens to everyone) and your 20min Midas invoker mid starts flamming you, little to your knowledge his mate is playing jungle AM and gets a 45 bf. He is also blaming you for doing shit and now you got 2 more reports and a 6 month ban. Automated systems don't work, valve's customer service proves this. 
Your spelling is though
That goes without saying, but no point to excuse it like so many do. No idea why people (probably kids) flame pros. 
Who got an undeserved invite ever?

Well, the idea of the award is that there is a jury that nominates 10 people by category, then the public votes on the site (which we will improve), then out of the 4 finalists the jury selects the winner. And their criteria are mysterious even for us.
Again you only take success into account. Kuroky is boring. 
Venomancer Necro viper meta was too cancerous and everyone wants to forget 
Lol... Australia is one of the best countries in the world. 
arteezy is loved worldwide too 
True, but we need to start with something :)
You sound really mad about your current situation in life. Go outside and stop spamming twitch champ. \n\n\nI queue because I love this game. Is that hard to understand? 
Well, we as organizers do not judge the quality of what our jury selects. The guy who was responsible for the MOBA category this year is Samy Ouerfelli, head of ESL France, and I guess he is quite "knowledgeable" ! But we understand that whoever is elected, more people will be unhappy with it than happy :)\nNext year vote whom you think deserves better!
And Dendi is interesting, because he smiles a lot for the camera and is a nice guy?
That was a joke, man!\nObviously we accept the blame. It's just the 1st year and we are already happy that it went the way it went. And the jury was not too bad: MOBA section for instance was managed by head of ESL France, and we had Daigo Umehara for Sports and missharvey for FPS! But we will obviously get better next year, with your help!
Your team mates shouldn't suffer with your bad English. \n\nThe internet is fixed now. Point is. I literally can't play the game due to 2 abandons. 
Why not then make a parallel Reddit jury next year? We are absolutely up for it.
&gt; ESL\n\n&gt; "knowledgeable"\n\nshit's getting funnier by the minute
Yes? Thats how it works. What is so hard to grasp? Lmao. \nThere is a reason he gets the biggest cheer from a crowd still. 
&gt; MOST OVERRATED MOBA GAMER OF ALL TIME DendiFace
Sorry, but by that logic someone like Arteezy would be much more deserving. He actually appears in front of crowds regularly and people always cheered like crazy when he appeared during the events I was at.\n\nHe even has a bigger following on twitter than Dendi and an almost equal amount of followers on twitch if you really want to go into this based on "who is the most popular guy".
Your team mates shouldn't suffer with your bad sarcarsm.
I was, as explained in another comment. Look man, honestly: we knew it's not gonna be 100% perfect the 1st year, but we're trying and we're open to any critics so we become better.
I never said he was deserving? I said everyone loves him and finds him interesting because of the reasons you said. \n\nYoure a bit slow ay m8? Lmao
People barely spoke of dendi in the past years. Maybe he was special a few years back, but he's almost forgotten, just like navi. Matumbaman, arteezy, miracle, they're far more popular. If the russians like dendi it doesn't mean the rest of the world does.
So you needed an incentive to stop being a worthless piece of shit?\n\n&gt; Nice.
It's not that we don't see it. Just try to see it from our perspective: the community is vast, and has its own views on everything and everyone (I'm talking about any community, from esports to football to formula 1). What we did, is organizing a jury and a public vote. The real problem is the fact that as we are a project that comes from some enthusiasts and not a huge group, we did not have the ressources to ensure global promotion so all of the community members could vote and give their opinion. So we got that that jury and those who voted - voted for Dendi. But we definitely want to "calibrate" the voting part better for the next years. I am convinced that this type of award is necessary for the industry. 
you just asked who got an undeserved invite and he gave you one, popularity is irrelevant when talking about who deserves an invite since it should be for the best teams
&gt;EG flair\n\n\n&gt;Dense as fuck\n\n\nSeems about right.
This shit is pathetic Valve.  At least they have an actual group stage this time instead of a single Bo1 play in match.
Most overrated ?  Loda, GTFO.
I see your point. But then again: we rather provide a platform than manage who the winner is. The jury nominates, the people vote, the jury selects the winner. Then we take the shitstorm on Reddit in our faces :)\n\nBut in any case, like it or not, we will keep working on making this award more relevant and more influential, so all your remarks are being noted.
Report those people.\n\nIf i were to rank the most toxic in SEA\nId say\n\n1. Malayshits/Pignoys\n2. Indogs.\n\nMalayshits are so toxic they would report you out of fun.\nPignoys same + they brag all the time but no skills specially from newer accounts.\nIndogs from what I'VE experienced they just trashtalk nothing else. 
&gt; I cannot think of anyone close.\n\nMaybe that's because the other pros haven't been given enough screentime? Maybe the other pros were never truly the face of Dota 2? Maybe the other pros weren't in Free to Play?\n\nNow I don't wanna take anything away from Dendi. That guy has been through many tough times with a smile on his face. But we have to accept that the other players haven't been given the opportunity to be what Dendi was.
&gt;Unreadable\n\nDo you mean **Unreable**?
How long do you die at lvl 1? Is this enough to tp and walk to bounty?
Lul no one knows, hence the jokes that she might actually be a dude using voice changer or smth xD
This picture explains why you shouldn't use mspaint.
Artizi deserve this prize hand down
Maybe because runes are not towers? Hmmmmmmmm?
As i said, Kuroky was more succesful than Dendi, but Dendi is the face of moba.
Kuroky is boring you say? \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wHi4L43hro&amp;t
Probably a bug.
Why are the shittiest suggestions like this one always getting up voted to the top?
what an achievement to be the 2nd best CIS team\n
no its in english
That can be interpreted in many ways.  \nBest e-sports player is more towards the definition you're going for; gamer can be very general.
Your team mates shouldnt suffer with moron like u. I hope u get banned for ruining games.
I didn't know there was any event held in Cannes. What the hell is this site even. And to think you bothered Samy Ouerfelli to be part of this.. lul\n\nThat's peak french esport community for you, reddit. Clueless for the most part and a lot of string-pulling.
No worries man, I play DOTA2 myself (even if I'm rather a HOTS guy), and rudeness is something I'm not afraid of :)\nI understand your point, but then again, we rely on our jury members and their assistants for the choice of nominees, and on the public vote for the wins. And even if I agree with all of your arguments about Dendi, interfering with how the vote went would have been worse than just letting it pass in a transparent way.\n\nBut anyways, what will definitely be done, is that we should increase the role of the community (= you) in the nomination. It was just our first year. We will get better :)
omg i cant stop laughing on that Vega vs FTM 2nd map. literally every team fight is OMEGALUL. that game is not just 322, it is now 3220 at this point of the game
Was? Until TI7 not even close. 
&gt; God   \n\nhow much of a fucking loser do you have to be to pick that nick  
He clearly isnt ruining every game if he climbed to ancient 0. Probably just dropped once every 10-15 games on average. 
Indeed, but's mad at Dendi, and Na'Vi in general.
Listen, I know everyone likes dendi myself included but hes not the best at anything right now.
/u/eSports_Beef How do the boys feel about the pressure of not getting paid if they lose?  \n\nAre they using it to push themselves or is it adding unneeded stress?
Someone probably scummed the voting, Dendi is very cool dude and I am glad he is part of the dota2 scene but if look into the last 4 years he has no accomplishments.\n\nEither that or the people who run this site are incompetent as hell.
Thank you for your kind words. "This site even" is our initiative to promote esports and gamers through awards and news. We're just in the beginning and I think what we are doing is important, and we are not planning to stop, but rather continue to become more relevant and more important. You are perfectly welcome to give advises about how to make it more interesting, but there is absolutely no need in throwing shit at what we are doing: we are just as much esports enthusiasts as you.
I can describe this perfectly with one word: lol
&gt;MOBA gamer\n\nCringe.
PuppeyFace
Not really. People in every region are hesitant to use their reports aimlessly. You don't get many of them so it's best to save it for the toxic. This guy was probably shit talking his epic cool aa strat and got blasted by everyone in the game. 
Lil is really behind in practice so he needs time on a team where he isn't even close to the weakest link LULW
Towers don't provide 40 gold to each player on your team tho, it's different.
You should probably specify what makes him so exceptional in your opinion, because, especially in recent times, what he's achieved doesn't seem impressive at all compared to what other professionals have done.
You guys will find anything to fight about . Why shoud a team like navi get paid when they were invited and hadn't have to work to get there , remeber ti1-4 those were exciting times top8 get everything while 9-16get nothing, remember screaming bulba when he beat lgd and got top8 that was fkin glorious.
Man, let me be clear.\n1. I am NOT shifting the blame on anyone - I just think that there is nothing and noone to blame! The jury did their job. They are awesome people and real pros of the industry. \n2. There is absolutely no desire in my actions to bait anyone anywhere. We will provide better content and I hope you will change your opinion about GG. 
GH had the second quickest turnaround from going pro to winning TI of any player after Sumail, I think.
Not sure where I asked for a lukewarm PR answer. Even if i deserved that touch of sarcasm on top of it.\n\nI don't question your enthusiasm, but what you're bringing on the table. Mild articles, mild answers, poorly designed website and somehow, big names to draw attention. Nothing different that any other esport thing we already have out there.
Dendi in 2018 OMEGALUL
Surprised Miracle isn't even in pool but 7mad is there, the best is Dendi? right now, seriously? i only see Noone who has a reason to be there
really? not GH, the guy who literally won TI, got mvp was his teams most important player, and just says im happy to play with these amazing people who are all better than me? ok, give it to a memer who hasnt been relevant in ages and only has a good personality, like many other dota pros do
I'm just playing devil's advocate on the verdict.
lol wtf 
Hmm, wonder why you have an F score.
The +90 GPM Talent it's just broken imho
You know the pool of options was good when 7ckingmad is an option
Hey what does this remind me of....Oh yeah\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJEm7eYb9wE\n\nThis super popular Youtuber who does CS vids that this completely rips off.
So what? It is $1m tournament and its prize pool distribution is basically the same as it was in the first TIs when prize pool wasn't too big

Not the way to please the region you're in, especially after that Ohaio drama.\n
That is so unbelievably far from the truth.
Something something your mother
Yeah but four of them have played out of NA before, although for PLD it was pretty briefly. \n\nYou can take the man out of NA, but you can't take NA out of the man. 
not the sharpest pencil in the box
becos they planned the event 5 years ago specifically for China. Kappa.
8k only? Scrub
NA boys downvoting you  lmao, Let's be fucking honest though, fnatic can live with out EE and PLD.
Someone explain what's going on and how I can abuse this. Cheats enabled?
You need to click it to your self or self cast it to work because Ags can target allies so maybe thats the reason it got cancelled. The mechanics got suddenly change dota got confused haha

why is faith not using the lift properly? cost them a few kills\n\nhe'd just not pulling properly and letting everyone drop right down to the same spot
The enemy OD just bought 7 Sentry Wards, went invis, and put them right on the ground where he knew Rubick would click microseconds before he clicked. Rubick just notices the wards and the entire team is so distracted by the "glitch" that they don't pay attention and lose.\n\nNext level. Kappa
Newbee毕竟内战王，打vg这么厉害然而Major的时候被打出屎。
Hello there
BSJ. Ever the source of some fuckery.
Rime is so cute
Classic Newbee, always feeding on the other CN teams then choke on Western teams. 
Well, Nyx Assassin really is a sneaky bug. 
This recent major was good for true sight...Esl Katowice was full of Stories,Shocks,Roster Change....But there was No awesome Final....So I think No true sight for now....
Heh look at you being not pathetic at all
Thats a Nyx joke
Are you autistic, bro? Did you even?

Shanghai with 6/16 Chinese Teams. This is so dumb.

What about Fnatic? :(
Fanatic is not better than EG. DPC points are one thing but in a best of 5 I’d take EG. 
Uh, was it really necessary to respond as if you know the answer AFTER the user has answered himself completely differently?
Just dont ult loooooooool 4Head\n
There is nothing to test. I have already stated the exact way the abilities work. There is no separate upgraded ability.
If you dont watch dota just shut the fuck up
Randoming function is great btw xd
God, these Chinese slots in Shanghai. 3 teams with 0 points, one of those directly invited.\n\nThere should be invite rules next season for sure.
haha, yes

Is that not Rosh dispelling the illusions immediately? It seems in time with it. 
what the fuck, that's not even how it worked before illusions died to rosh. the illusions had to hit rosh first, he doesn't just autokill them if they enter the pit, and that's not even how it works any more, illusions can hit rosh.

Yeah because it ruins games. Wanna play random? Go sd/rd and don't waste other people's time.

"3 qualifying spots for CN teams in Shanghai Major" \n\nSeemsfairman.
If u warded a lot in the game then thats why u had so much impact and u do a lot of damage and stun for a good time so that boosts it up too so i guess thats why, and the AI isnt perfect
could it be ur mmr is low cause u play wisp. not trying to offend. just wondering cause i think wisp is hard to play

Fuck randoming remove that shit entirely
Did they win tho?
Especially lgd /s
I'm sure they're gutted. I'm sure you tell your local supermarket that if they won't let you out without paying, you won't shop there anymore too.
So fucking retarted joke. I feel bad for your autism and everybody who upvoted this shit.
Their website is trash however, so not visiting them at all might be the best play.
English might not be your first language but damn bruh..
Fucking Reddit ruined that shit by bitching about it every day. Randoming was great before, now you might as well remove that shit from the game, its so ass.
Dumbass admin, pauses affect gameplay during teamfights. That's why pauses during teamfights by players are viewed as "tactical"
"blyat blyat blyat blyat blyat"
Thanks for ruining randoming
First it is "affect", i don't understand why people keep saying "effect" instead.\n\nSecondly he asked for a pause before the beginning of the video, they just decided to ignore it.\n\nThird, unspoken rules are not rules, admins are referees ingame and have the authority to pause the game if they see fit.
