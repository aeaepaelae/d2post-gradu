Sure, he's farmed, but not into survivability.\

He's got good XP, but not that much more then opponents (he is 7, invoker is 6, pls is 6, NP is 4, rubick is 4 and lowest is roaming tusk at 3. So it's not massive level advantage either.\

Could they have played it better? Yeah, probably. But I still think this is bullshit level of """balance""".

TRIGGERED.
I swear it's like a staple of american culture to blame all their problems on other races/languages/whatever. Like if valve just banned all peruvians from US servers they wouldn't improve, because they'd just find a new scapegoat. NA players just can't handle that the problem with their games is themselves as individuals. From what I've seen of streams for all the regions, NA definitely has the most toxic and irresolute region culture of all.\
\
^^^^^american ^^^^^downvotes ^^^^^incoming ^^^^^woo
It's not weird. Valve secretly added a region-grouping function. Basically you get grouped with people near and around you. So those 5 Peruvians got into 1 team because they are, incidentally, all playing from Peru(Or its neighboring ($hithole)countries)). Same thing with me and a LOT of other true NA players.
.... Which means you lose tangos.

Yea and even if you ROLL the guy who lose the roll can still go that roll. So i prefer sticking with who points the minimap. \
\
At the end of the day is just a game, and there's no rules either for a team composition. If i can have fun playing the game, and at least try to do something, i'm ok with having 5 people on the mid lane.
I don't know how letting the RNG to decide is fair, but OK. I'm not saying that who point first is 100% fair or whatever, but yea, in the end there's no FAIR way to decide.\
\
But in my experience with RNG i never had any luck, so in no way i'm gonna start use it now.

Yes, this is a bad bracket. No, it's not because EG has an easy first round opponent. That's how it's supposed to work.
arise is an ass....
I checked your worldcloud and you're being mean in a video game. You deserve everything that happened and more. /s
lmao what a bipolar idiot. I thought I couldn’t make up my mind then I read this
Based on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ0DWNyRtrU) he could've just gone and farmed the jungle since he saw void on the map depushing creepwaves.
So he was just sitting in base doing nothing. Working as intended tbh.
That is a bit wrong statement. \
\
What should system do? - detect afk players. \
\
Now it is made to reset special timer when you die or when you get xp. So he died, got reset, wasted 120s waiting to be alive, then he wasted another 3 mins hiding from void. So timer didn’t reset for 5 mins in total = he got an abandon. \
\
How should it work to detect afk players in 100% cases and not to punish nice guys = that is hard question. \
\
Yes, we can suggest some improvements... but that is different story. Basically, we should adapt to this and hope that Valve will do their best. 
As someone who watches a lot of streams, I agree with you. I even watched his stream whenever he's playing magnus, those plays on Youtube were rarer than a unicorn. Iceiceice magnus is even better tbh. \
\
Edit: I'm not saying he's a bad magnus, he's a good magnus and definitely a million times better magnus player than me. I'm not just as amazed as the Youtube highlights compared to the games I've witnessed him play Magnus. I might just be unlucky to watch and he happened to have an unlucky match-up. Please do read carefully and with comprehension. Thanks.\

Wtf dude what do the pro players have to do with this? Ofc there is no reason to stay in fountain for longer than 1 minute in any game at any stage of the game with any hero, btw I'm talking about decent mmr games here where players actually use the map they play on
LMAO wow what an insanely huge announcement to make AFTER the roster lock.  gj valve
The exact situation is not known publicly obviously but it was stated he had anxiety issues and the team appeared to want to play with someone else and were pressuring him to not play.  Iirc Era did still want to play or else they would have been able to sub him out with valve's blessing but it all got really awkward.
Valve's statement was about individual players being invited.  This new system gives individual players points, so cool, now it's really like individual players are being invited!  Their website only said that breaking roster locks would cost them some unknown number of points but now it turns out it costs them all their points and all their new teammates their points and also they aren't considered for invitations to the regional qualifiers.  Yes this IS how things worked in the old system but we have a new system and this latest tweet is not in line with how the new system appeared to be working.  \
\
  All this stated I'm totally fine with how they ARE doing it I just think that this is a very important rule that should have been stated from the start.
The DPC points did change that rule. Not by statement but by implication.\
\
WHAT IF WE NEED TO MAKE ROSTER CHANGES AFTER THE LOCK?\
Playing with a roster that's significantly different from a registered roster will incur point penalties, similar to using subs (see the FAQ on Majors and Minors).\
\
 see http://www.dota2.com/majorsregistration/home/\
\
Valve's new statement is a direct contradiction to their previous statement.\
\
A point penalty is mute if you swap after the lock because you forfeit all points as you can no longer be invited directly or to the regionals.\
\
No one assumed that if you swapped you would be forced to play opens. That is why up to this point, there was always the question about players swapping right before TI to make it into the top 8 DPC position and getting an invite.\
\
The new statement also eliminates the idea of individual players having points... Puppey could leave Secret right now, having one of the hightest individual point totals... but it doesn't matter. Both puppey's new team and secret could not be invited to TI as they would have broken the roster lock.\
\
Saying DPC didn't change anything is just not accurate.\

If this is the case, why does Valve give the points penalty rule for 2-3 players change? You can give a valid reason for 1 player unable to play, but for 2-3 players, well.... \
I think Valve initially thought teams can change players and get reduced points as a penalty, but then a question about open qualifiers came up and they have to announce the latest news, am I right?\
Valve should have done this at the beginning of this season though. \

I  like tttheee people .

So you are basically reposting the comment from original post with loading screen? You didn't even took your own profile screenshot, you just took their. Reddit never changes, lol.\

LOLOLOL rekt me hard. My feelings are hurt. Good thing I can get some emotional support from my friends.
NOT TRYING TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS IM JUST HERE MAKING JOKES.\
\
LIKE WHEN YOUR FRIEND DROPS SOMETHING AND YOU SAY "NICE JOB ASSHOLE"
Or tell sing to grow a pair? Krappa
The concept is pretty cool but execution is so-so for me. I really think the theme song needs to be changed, it sounds like a sarcastic parody of game show intro music. Singsing is not a great guest either, he barely speaks and has no on-camera confidence. Also there should be more rounds where the two teams are competing in a much more direct manner, like answering 1 question each in some sort of 'lightning round', or just throwing questions open and any team can answer using a buzzer. And I get why you want lots of Dota guests to start with since thats what your followers know, but a more diverse range of esports guests from other games - people you could introduce to us by posting mini bios/profiles on social media, for example, before an Ep. is released - would help spice things up too. Seeing the guests actually PLAY games or do something game-related -- making the viewing experience kinda similar to Twitch streams -- might also be fun!    \
  \

edit: I see now that towards the end of Episode 3 there was a lightnting round. Says a lot though that I didn't even get that far into the episode to realise. Tobi having to yell STOP was also quite cringe :( seemed genuinely angry. Gotta let that banter run free! The contestants are mature enough to get back on track eventually when the joke stops being funny.
That phase boot got me\

[AM Hits him long time long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP7utU8Efow)
First of all: just Monika. Almost missed my /r/UnexpectedDDLC moment there.\
\
For the rest, I guess it's subjective whether 20m greaves constitutes being "defensively stacked" on a Tide.\
\
My thinking was that for all the duration of the clip tide was &gt; 20% hp. Once he was under that, he'd get an extra 15 armor and 12 regen. Between that, Kraken Shell, and Anchor Smash, I'm not sure AM could EVER kill Tide (in that particular fight).\

Funny the one time I played necro this patch was in offlane and we won xd
can pigs effectively wear capes? :thinking:
laughed irl
It's funny how Valve is getting praised for features that should have been there in the first place. I wonder if they do it on purpose and leave out obvious features to be 'improved' on later lol
 I agree with him tho Kappa 123
you know atleast he is still trying. and looking at the scoreboard, with a few more heroes they could possibly get a big comeback gold target.\
\
(im so pissed at this clip really)

I mean.. When you're TB and farming jungle nonstop, you should be able to watch teamfights meanwhile.
Me_irl when someone bitches about no miss call... like damn how hard can it be to last hit in a free lane and watch your minimap
even that combo can't save EE though.... 
RIP ears.. thanks for serving me for years..
Lol, it gave him mana which allowed AM to burn him down again anyway, so it gave him armour and about 100 health in the end\
\
"Stacked defensive items" lol. Its funny you're so condescending but your comments are so dumb. Like in the first place you said he stacked defensive item*s*, when he has literally got 1 defensive item, then your like "Greaves" when he only got it at the end and it did nothing, but you don't seem to understand that

I have seen short films that have way better content than this promotional video. They could have hired one of the content creators from SFM, because this was so brainlessly executed. Most of the song was just characters sitting and staring. And it makes no sense that dota 2 heroes not using abilities in fights and are punching each other...

I don't really like it tbh, now if a tyler bates composed a music pack and was released for dota 2....\

TAKE MY GOD DAMN MONEY\
\
-----------------\
\
The reason I don't like awolnation is because they rely too much on musical composition vs putting work into musical lyrics, If there is any one that is sorta like that genre I like it would be woodkid, overall pop music doesn't have allot of good music in it, what I mean by that is music theory.\

So does my flair :)

If you dont care about this bar because it is not on the dota map regardless of it being in the lore and you being able to read the comics  in the client,  then what about the fucking multitudes of locations shown in LoL videos that are not in the LoL map ??!!  jesus christ dude.   \
Valve are not a near - pixar level animation studio  like RioT are , and LoL is much larger  / profitable than dota. \
Sure valve could do a WHOLE lot more with the millions we give em , and with icefrog's recent commitment it seems they are headed in the right direction.    \
Agreed that it is just a bad video. It is shot for shot of the original video done by a single guy so not much to work with.    \

A big clap for ESL LMAO
its official now. these guys hate the dota community. like atleast have the first quarterfinal played live too... that would make it 5 series LIVE. yes its not much but still something atleast. or have 4 quarterfinals atleast. fuck esl these guys continue to impress with their hatred towards the dota community. #FuckESL

i know i'll get downvoted for going against the circlejerk but you guys need to understand that the ARENA only has **the weekend** available and ESL most likely couldn't book the friday, or i'm wrong and they did it on purpose..who knows\

I'm mad. Like, seriously mad. I was hoping to stay whole weekend, watching all the playoff games, but instead of that we're getting THIS. Thank you ESL, first Facebook, now this. I wonder, what's next on your plan to fuck up.\
It doesn't hit me so hard, since I live like around 30 kilometres from Katowice, but what about people, who are coming from other countries? Paid hundred of dollars for hotels, flights, saved for food and all, only just for four games? And what the hell is this about single elimination?\
Right now I'm really considering staying at home and watching the tournament on B-dog's stream or anyone else.
# #fuckESL\
\

But... you can. As I mentioned the enemy might have died to towers or creeps i.e. no player deliver the killing blow.

Why not have a main stage and side stations. Run multiple series at once. Give people a chance to see these teams play

 4 of which went 2-0\

BUT THIS IS FUCKING MAJOR ?!?! \
\
People fly in from different continent for this shit? \

nice major ESLUL
I was going to this tournament and was actually quite excited about another major in Europe... especially the 16 team format. not driving all the way to Poland for watching 4 teams tho. I was considering not going after how the esl staff acted on twitter around the last comp but I thought "hey ... I can at least still watch some of my favorite teams ... also teams like navi and optic I don't usually see." \
\
Now It will be the same 4 teams I alrdy watched in hamburg. Gg esl
First FB ONLY stream and now THIS? WTF? I just do not like this fucking ESL. NO MORE MAJORS FROM ESL PLZ.
ESLUL is back boys
FUCK ESL. boycott these idiots.
What a fucking shit show ffs
TL:DR- ESL doesn't know what gaming audiences want anymore, too blinded by Facebook/advertising money. ESL new slogan- Money good, audience at events or online who cares.
Still lost by the rules he made trying to cheat lol
There is a fucking ONE match on sunday. ONE FUCKING FINAL.\
\
Im actually living in Poland and I was really happy about this event, me and my 3 bois are going, tickets are bought, rooms are booked.\
\
We took day off the work to be able to come back calmly after expecting 22:00 closing. And we will probably manage to make it in same day, what a fucking joke.\

This is the first Dota 2 event in Poland, that was really good way to promote this game in here, go fuck yourself ESL.

Other than perhaps the Techies, no one wins in a game with a Techies. All my reports are used on techies, it's the only real toxic shit since they decide from minute 1 that they will ruin the game for everyone else...
It's kind of like how I've never heard someone genuinely say "did you just assume my gender?" un-ironically. \

I mean, I may be waaaaaaay off here, but all the hilary and trump memes were being planted by Russia you gotta wonder how far the (rather successful) attempt at disillusion goes.

Everything you are talking about is with a coordinated team. If I could control the actions of my team, Id pick Lycan and make them pick death prophet, shadow shaman, dk and a 4 position and just have them fight on one side of the map while the lycan destroys every tower. Probably wouldnt lose a game. BUT I cant control my teammates. If you solo push you usually die unless you are AM, who is terrible right now, because your team isnt pressuring the map, they are fucking jungling because it is the only place safe from techies. 
One of the best feelings in the game is reporting the techies and then checking their dotabuff a few days later to see that they're playing ''single draft'' games LUL
And techie players wonder why they keep eating reports.\
\
I love reporting techies and then a couple of days later checking their DB profile to see them playing in low priority. Almost makes up for playing with techies LUL

There're arguments both ways for this. We know this is true because people are getting LP for being bitches chat, no comms ban and no abuse.

He didn't say that. Read context, notice that's neither what he said nor what was said in this particular chain. You're putting words in his mouth. He didn't say that, and the people he replied to didn't say it.\

And don't say but someone else in some other chain did. It doesn't excuse putting the words in this guys mouth. Go reply to the guy who ACTUALLY commented on competition (except oh wait, even he didn't say steam was doing it to squelch competition.

LOL what? "Advance" (*sic*) guide that has like half of it flat out wrong regarding when to and not to attack and whether let it be autoattack; therefore, a good chunk of it could be reduced to this paragraph and be done with:\
\
1. Analyze the situation and pick your target.\
2. Using the mouse, move the pointer to the chosen target.\
3. Right click.\
4. Profit!\
\
Since the hero functions normally during Ball Lighting, it can cast and attack during it, you just control *what* will it attack instead of letting it waste Overload charge on something else. Also, NOTHING can make a unit **next** attack slower or faster after it went on cooldown. Doing short zips won't let you attack any faster than attacking as usual. Now, I don't know whether he got that the hero has two different attack animations right, but I know that it yet again makes no difference on the overall attack rate, since, unlike abilities, that only have cast point defined for them, attacks have in addition to attack point a dynamic duration that is determined by a formula, with base attack time being the starting limit, further adjusted by increased attack speed. You also didn't tell a pretty big thing, that Overload can be applied to already in-flight attacks any time before they hit.

universe couldn't fucking get a decent call from all the anti axe spells. exorcism, silence deathward, mal edict, reflection, ravage, scorched earth. It had everything to do with the draft to pick an axe 2nd. He got countered hard herowise. But of course, an impotent hero on universe that hasn't been used in pro games for a loooooooong time gfor good reason gets second picked and blame the player holding him for bad play. LOL.

[Before](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6n1u5o/the_true_mmr_distribution/) vs. [After](https://www.opendota.com/distributions/ranks)
funniest part about this thread is that this is a low priority game (which op conveniently doesn't mention, yet he mentions a "top 200 player") and op is a serial game ruiner lmao\
\
https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3733275110 (op is magnus)
This is a bit ridiculous tbh. One thing to go on him for his poor reaction on Bulldog and his PR reaction which was awful, another to call on vote manipulation when it's not. That's fair play. You do what you can do get your name knows, and that start by friends, network, anyway you can. Don't be naive.\
\
&gt;Secondly (and this is what really rankles me) there are far better casters there who had their chance stolen who had been working hard for quite some time. I know Dota players (actual ones) are introvert and many are not active on FB. I consider this a stolen chance for them.\
\
You are making assumptions. On him not working hard or not on Dota, on dota player being introvert who deserve more and on a lot more stuff. And anyway, like I said, you got to do whatever you can to make up your brand and get known.\
\
&gt;You guys deserve transparency on this issue and information what .you chose to do with it is up to you.\
\
You really believe yourself when you type that ? Genuinely asking.\
\
I don't know this guy but like pretty much everybody here, I was not a fan of his flaming of Bulldog, nor his reaction to the whole mess, to me he basically ruined his chances in the next few months to cast anything dota-related for now. He doesn't have anything special in his cast, not an awful nor great voice, it was okayish at best. But cut him some slack, this is getting kinda silly tbh.\
&gt;And lastly he’s just an impressionable college going youth who made a mistake cut him some slack.\
\
Lmao really, after all the stuff you just wrote. Alright if you got some issues with this guy, you don't need to hide yourself behind the self-righteous idea of bringing the ''truth'' to the ''brotherhood'', I don't know man, that's pretty bs to say that after the whole post being written in a certain way.\
\
Btw, a poll on Twitch or on Reddit would have bring other issues too.\

Well, ideally the "campaign" is targeted towards a relevant audience. It's not against the rules to ask other people to vote too, but it might be unethical at a certain level. \
\
Regardless, it's of course the organizers who has the main responsibility to ensure contest hits the relevant people. And if enough regular viewers had voted, this "loophole" wouldn't be so easily exploited in the first place, be that "accidental" or on purpose.

Hey now I'm married and despite my mother's insisting me last year (when we were engaged) that I should get my then-fiance flowers or something I reminded her of what *she* decided that Valentine's is stupid.

if someone knowingly sells you a defective product, then when you complain simply give you what you expected in the first place, do they deserve accolades or did they simply do what was expected of them?\
\
sure, esl can have as many games as they 'want' on stage, but certainly there was an expectation that there would be more (there are more at almost every lan i've ever watched). they didn't go above and beyond here. \
\
if they don't fuck up schedules for the next events, then sure they should be forgiven
you forgot the " :) " smiley in there.
Did they fixed that heavy lag in some big spells like mk ult?  I dont wanna play if that sh*tis not fixed....
Tbh, I like the previous version more.

No, we get ":)"...\

This praise is genuine. He did great as a solo caster/observer. He didn't miss more hero kills than the current veteran casters generally do when they also have to observe while solo casting. Sure most of his analysis was simple play by play, but he kept up with the action and item builds. He got me hyped at the right times. All in all, considering this guy is a new caster (and isn't a pro player) I couldn't reasonably ask for more. Hopefully he casts more big games and gets some more experience under his belt, but he's off to a great start.
Its okay, but to me the major stumbling block is fans only getting to see 5 different teams play, out of the 16 that made it to the 'LAN'. This extra game doesnt increase the number of teams you get to see.
FeelsBadMan :gun:
Every time he said VIH-SAJH instead of viz-ij, i became very very angry. Other than that..not bad casting.
what happened to fnatic was they are gonna beat their way to win ti 8 beating liquid secret vp newbee eg og mineski with ee sama as carry and captain. i am not delusional weeb btw Krappa
He is the new Toby kenoby, calling it. You go Optic. Cheezy :)

earth shaker es kotl wisp. HUGE pool
Let's deconstruct everything you said about your pros and why I feel you are a Fnatic shill and just an A-grade sociopath :\
\
&gt;Pros - Ohaiyo gets a share of the money, 5 people get to play a major they otherwise might not have been able to.\
 ?? What ? Ohaiyo is getting his share of the money, I don't understand how it's a pro, its his right. I don't understand how you can spin that as a 'pro'.\
Who cares about the 5 people who get to play or not, you are a sociopath, look at what they did and how they did it to Ohaiyo, look at how the events occurred. I don't even understand your reasoning here, what they did was almost inhuman, here I'll SPELL IT OUT TO YOU :\
\
1. They won quals with Ohaiyo\
\
2. They made him think he's going to the major when they ALL knew he wasn't ( yes scumbag EE, Universe piece of shit, Eric Khor the backstabber and hyped-up (lul Tier 1 team after Ti6 lul) Adam) \
\
3. They ORGANIZED a PARTY and in his moment of euphoria, kicked him in the nuts.\
\
You are a sociopath, almost as bad Fnatic for not understanding what he's gone through. You are listing pros and cons like there's no tomorrow when you can't understand what's happened. People like you honestly need stuff like this to happen to you, then you go around making your pro and con list. \
\
Coming back to TNC, yes they kicked 1437 but not the way Fnatic did, they infact persevered with him after they won those qualifiers but it wasn't working out and it was quite apparent, what happened was shitty but it wasn't a kick in the balls like it was for Ohaiyo and yes 1437 is also getting his money. \
\
I honestly hope Fnatic crash and burn these TI qualifiers and in all the tournaments from now on, this is bad karma and it'll bite them in the butt one way or the other.\

He's still 2 so... 
Playing against retarded enemies, SO HARD TO BE DONE.

\
Accept the fact that you have literally 0 power. Your words in this regard (and this goes for ALLof us) is worth about nothing. \
\
You can say all you want, but Gaben chan won’t care. \
Wanna know why? Because the precious charts you guys publish EVERY SINGLE DAY are made by steam, and steam is made by Valve, and oh boy Valve has Dota. You think they don’t read the same charts they make?\
They know the player base has decreased. They don’t need ANY OF US to remind them that. Even more, they don’t need our crappy suggestions about role based matchmaking or something like which, according to many, would solve the problem; and for that I’m goddamn happy because it would ruin the game. \
We have about 700.000 daily players and you’re worried the game is fucking dead? Call of duty, call of freaking duty, rarely hits these numbers after a month from its release.\
\
What’s your problem then? You’re afraid of LoL players who’re gonna bully us because we have less players? You seriously care about it?\
Who the fuck does? \
Just play the goddamn game, it’s Valve’s current main interest, you seriously believe they’re just gonna toss it in the trash can? You think they’re gonna (KEK) prioritize ARTIFACT OVER DOTA?\
\

thats how he speaks usually.. raves on personalities now and then. definately hypes up anything/anyone he gets excited about. when he is not excited.. just shuts up and can be extremely dull!! lol. he calls everyone shit too.. as a joke i assume (and explains why if they are not on the stream..usually a close friend like conrad).. anyway he knows them well enough to bag them..just called fogged shit like 3 times on the stream. on the otherhand when he fanboys (as per video) he usually says something like..i respect _insert name_ so much b/c this one time when this happened _insert story_. that's just how he talks. mostly entertaining. worst case gives up some behind the scene industry stories which is always nice.

I'm not getting white knightly in the sense that I'm defending him, because I'm not defending him, I never was.

Not what I proposed. If you're talking about low-priority, that's obviously not the same. I'm talking about a mode with all the same things as normal matchmaking, where you can play AP, RD and CM on MMR, just with people who don't mind flaming and where you can't bitch about it, literally, as in making reports, since you go to play there willingly, and no one is stopping you from playing in the no-flame zone instead.\
\
&gt;You get matched with nicer people based on your behavior score, the more commendations you receive and the overall nicer you are, the better your behavior score, and therefore the more people you have in your games that are nice. If you are constantly finding yourself in games with flamers, just sounds to me like your behavior score is low, bringing us back to what I said earlier about you likely not being as nice as you make yourself out to be.\
\
Source needed for claims relating to who you get matched with. As for your claims about me, I quite clearly told you what I think about the viable way to play - if you're flaming *and* you're not playing with your team because you're upset at them, that's a problem. If you can flame and play well, then I don't care.\
\
&gt;About weaker players getting commendations, commendations don't improve your skill, literally, everyone knows this. No one is using '# of commends' as their primary talking point. \
\
I get plenty of commendations and none of them are for "niceness", just for successfully carrying people to success.\
\
https://snag.gy/LhM5zR.jpg\
\
I barely even talk in Dota, as I wrongly get grouped with Russians even though I'm of the same cultural, historical and regional ilk as Cancel^^ and w33.\
\
&gt;If someone has a ton of commends and they're in my game, that means they are likely equally skilled with me, and also a nice person, someone I'd very much like to have in my game, let alone my team. \
\
This is what makes me think you're naive and bad at this game, along with anyone that upvotes you and downvotes me.\
\
&gt;TL;DR: Stop flaming in-game, improve your behavior score, and you'll have better games, commends help improve behavior score, and overall promote positivity in players, therefore they provide value.\
\
Ugh, see my earlier point.

2.Its impossible double click to go full screen or reduce to small screen (very annoying when using a wireless mouse and you constantly have to move across the room for a quick peek at the other game)" \

Or just... adjust your build that game. I always buy urn on Phoenix, but if there's a Pudge or an Earth Spirit I'll let them get it since it will get more mileage. 
Thanks for explaining the obvious. (:

you have a completed spirit vessel before your teammate buys an urn? I think you have other issues here m8

True af
why are you getting downvoted lul it's actually true
Haha 25 mins and game one is over. Game two might be even faster if Navi keeps drafting like this.
My mmr is around 1-2k. My overall conduct is bad and no I'm not toxic. After being matched with toxic players every single game i have no intentions of playing this game nor trying to carry my team for whole 50 minutes and right clicking on creeps just to not get disconnected. Valve system is broken, community is biggest problem but Valve is reason why these toxic players are not banned already. Saying that he is probably bad because he could't carry team of 4 moron feeders is not only stupid but makes you look like you are toxic too since you defend these toxic feeders. \
\
Today I got matched 4 matches in a row with mid or feed and I just quit because I'm not no lifer to stay 40 minutes waiting for match to finish I'd rather do something useful. Currently in low priorirty again coz of abandons and I have no intensions of playing Dota again no metter how much game is FREAKING AWESOME the community and system is terrible and makes me never open game again. \
\
Good job Valve, in 2015 there was over 800,000 players now there is around 500,000 on average. U officially killed over 300,000 player base and u keep going
classic reddit retards. the hate for NaVi is fucking real. every comment i read is about them being trash. sick. lets just ignore the fact that the roster just formed like 10 days ago and they had bootcamped for 5 days. and its their first lan with new players. and its fucking NEWBEE. Newbee. new fucking bee. just keep that in mind before you continue to start typing that they are back to the dumpster and shit like that lmfao 
Lmao what is general doing , he has 10 second to use anything but he give away the split.\

Salty fangay LUL new roster LUL\
Just can't accept the fact that navi can only deal with tier 2 or 3 teams
1. Void has a Chrono radius talent as well ;) and you can make Aether Lens as you mentioned.\
\
2. It's a smoke trivia, very rarely you'll any of this actually happening. But it would reveal smoked heroes.
You what to know what is really sad? People still use Twitlonger in 2018. SMH
I mean....this is a valid question (minus the "too"), many people use the "I will purchase X item" to state the need of that item to be purchased and not that they want to purchase that item.
By following along with your teams bad decisions (taking stupid fights, going up highground way too early, trying to rosh when its for sure going to end in disaster etc. etc.) instead of making better plays. When your team makes stupid plays, you have to go along with it and lose yourself the game or get reported.\
\
You know who REALLY deserves to be reported? Players who tilt because their allies are doing something they don't agree with. THAT should be a punishable offence.
because...?
In their minds, they absolutely *are* the best player on the team.  My last match (ID: 3744406685), our Abbadon was given safelane solo.  He died three times before anything else happened.  I'm holding mid, and while comm banned (and I swear to fuck, this only happens when I get a straight run of nothing but Peruvians who can't understand me andsimply stop talking) I'm calling my missings properly.  SB is charging left and right, he's caught out of position four or five times, killed twice by the charge.  "WHY IS NO ONE CALLING FUCKING SB MISSING?!"  And we are.  I'm calling SF missing, though SF was pretty decent.\
\
It's about 35 minutes of listening to Abba tell us that we were trash, supports should follow the carry (they were following me, because I was the one doing the work as Leshrac).  To him, though, Axe wasn't landing calls (he wasn't, to be fair),. I wasn't pushing towers (because I'm tryign to save his sorry ass more than I can push), WD and Lion are stealing his kills (yes, that WD is totally stealing your kills with Maledict).  Then he starts telling Lion, who is in his stack, "Your MMR clearly hasn't calibrated since we're playing with terrible players."  We were losing.\
\
The enemy BB ends up abandoning.  Abba leaves soon after once he told us all to uninstall and kill ourselves.  And after he left?  We fucking won.  His teammate didn't leave the game with him.  Hell, we *all* reported him for feeding, and I got my report back, so...yay!\
\
And because I'm *fair* in my criticism of shitters like this, the guy is American.
Lol Fy captaining lmaoooo
There is just no way Mineski can win this. DK can never comeback in a game. And DP is too weak in late game. They are way too far behind OG at this point.\

That though tbh is a very common thing people say.  Like Tobis prob my fav caster but thats just common saying of a lot of casters.
I mean, it's kinda easier to use that term instead of explaining what is an Ancient, in that way.\

Congrats on your free karma btw
That's actually my boy Jamal. He's kewl.
 EU DOTA LUL
If only I could be so grossly incandescent...
ez ? bm
To be honest I've never been a fan of shoutcasting. I much prefer people analyzing play. I do agree that there should be someone there for the play-by-play, but idk Tobi just rubs me the wrong way. At least he's not Aysee though, so it could be worse. But stuff like "This has never been done before in the history of dota" and random screaming isn't what makes me like dota. Seems more appropriate for a Brazilian soccer cast rather than a high complexity e-sport. That and I've never been impressed by Tobi's game knowledge... is he even ranked? To be fair I haven't followed the competitive scene for a few years so he could have improved, but it seems like the Tobi I knew before, not terrible, but an excuse I would use to stop watching a streamed game (it would take a lot for me to watch a whole game nowadays mind you).

God I wish people would stop complaining. You put millions of dollars to provide entertainment and then choose which platform to broadcast it through. They apologized, it's over. Bet you people would complain even if it was on TV prime time like a champion's league game because you can't spam a chat or write 14 year old "memes".

Uber = Dark Rift (they said EE tried to catch the uber but got swapped by VS)\

Mongoloid/Mongosaur= EE for being baited at around 50 min mark (they got pissed because he should have just went for the tower.. objective gaming)\
\
LoL \
\

&gt; rants about how his friends got addicted to this game that is comparable to drugs and cancer\
\
&gt; ends rant with "game is good" - "community isnt"
Name a game that has as many players that got rid of any problem - Boosting/Account Selling/Hacks???? Oh right none of them - Dota 2 - Still at an all time high on this shit. Pubg - highest of any game and still going with hacks.   Overwatch still huge on hacks - CSGO Huge on hacks have to literally go to ESEA to have a decent time rofl thats pathetic. Rocket League - Account boosting to the max. No matter what people will be able to do it and get away with it for a very VERYYYY long time there is no possible thing that can remedy this that was my point so yea you can pretend all you want the facts are on the paper buddy its a nasty thing going on and zero fix in sight or the next 5-10 years. Valve has said smurfs are fine....and all your ideas bring false positives no matter what so yea theres a reason no company does what you say.

Had to wait in the cold because the bags were not ready. No seperate food area for premium ticket holders. Who designed that ugly t-shirt? Everything is in Polish, barely anyone understands English, huge problems with security - locking people out, not letting people through (because wtf is a premium ticket, right? you came through here? well you can't go back). Premium seats are the worst - basically neck breaking, also hard wooden chairs when free seats are padded? We can't have food or drinks in the premium area but the rest of the arena is ok? At least you turned off the blinding lights. This event is a complete opposite of Hamburg. 
Post about it on their facebook page Kappa
Dude are you retarded? Who carries or knows his CC numbers without his card?? If we say a name - sure thats the best way; date of expiry? Yeah may be you somehow remember when your card expires; but the fuckinh 16 digits number? Jesus...
yeah america is so trash LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm premium ticket holder and I agree with everything you said here. \
\
I would like to add some minor things that really bugged me on top of that. Ater standing for 30min in cold in the queue, I wanted to leave my things in cloakroom and not only the told to pay for it, but pay for *each* thing I want to leave? wtf, I paid so much money for premium and they still rip off from me &gt;_&gt;\
\
And the food was the worst. We bought some popcorn and we couldn't enter the area, had to throw it away, because we didn't want to miss anything =.=\

Also, there suppose to be "premium" signing session after semi finals, but it didn't happen, because of delays, so again I kinda felt robbed...
alright since you found it i can be a dick and be a dad and go like :" what kind of an unresponsible ass are you ? HOW DO YOU LOSE YOUR WALLET IN A FOREGIN COUNTRY ?? HOW ARE YOU ALIVE EVEN ???\

HELLO?
To be fair you are complaining about things that you should have known beforehand if you read the information correctly. As I remember they usually give on the gift bag and you could have checked past events. Food information was also there and you know the layout of the floor plan &amp; seating. So again, you are complaining about things you should have known..

You call them idiots yet you paid for an ESL event LUL

LUL Facebook major LUL
So they fuck up real attendees and stream viewers alike? GG ESL
Wtf. This is the shittiest settings for fans. Even GB 2 is much better for fans. 
cough* herald cough*

It was really funny when I saw people with premium badges sitting next to us in the back of the arena... but at least the girls are really hot, yes I’m talking about you a lady from Red Bull stand with beautiful eyes!
I mean, he wants to remove the weakness of a skill that can clear waves at level 3..
Looks like MODS got bought by JD $$$
ESL surpassed Shanghai shitshow EleGiggle
ESl the meme bringer !!!\

NA fangays downvoted this LUL

You can afford pretty much everything if you got a good pr team (in case of EA you can afford it even if you don't :)) 
Insanely broken, Abed was playing like a God, should have won\
\
Edit: all the butthurt liquid fans downvoting me is hilarious xD
Idk BF Tide or Tusk is better
if Liquid is god then how did Liquid get 3rd place?\
\
WeSmart
&gt; stupid*s*\

sure thing
Coz China is god of gods ^^^^^#NoKappa
For EE, every death is necessary. They dont call him fEEdternal Envy for nothing. :)
fnashit looooooooool fangays
again and again and again. FACT: the talent is broken!
lmao pure skills more like borefest 
Actually they bough sentry for mid so i farmed agh :)
&gt; Secret \
\
&gt;don't have anything to hide from eachother
If I could wish anything for Fnatic and Envy it would surely be a little more **consistency** on the positive side. 
Clearly I don't read! That's not efficient.\

i mean.. they tried their best smileyface, dont be so harsh on them smileyface
Poor butthurt liquid fanboy :(
Jesus Christ are you retarded or what?\
\
 Do you even have any facts or are you just spewing bullshit based on a salty OP? \
\
There are **no** predetermined seats.\
\
 **All** seats are free and equal. \
\
OP's ticket was supposed to let him enter the arena earlier than those that didn't pay so that he could sit down before them but he doesn't actually own a designated seat so if for whatever reason he's unable to get one, guess what? Tough luck you were never entitled to one. \
\
You pay for the early access, the seat is just  a byproduct of it.
rofl, i think you're the idiot one here. how are you even gonna bring down TB if you're only jumping him with 1 hero? \
\
okay, initiator jumps in then what? you'll have to have your other cores to jump in as well to deliver the damage.\
\
"you really believe all 5 hero from opposite team at high enough hp to pull off a sunder?". he doesn't need 5 ENEMY heroes at high enough hp he can easily sunder his own teammates, he can easly sunder his own illusion.\
\

So this is why they left the signing session with people still left in the queue :(
you mean bulldog? OpieOP
He and Bulldog are why I watched it on facebook. If you're fans I understand the appeal, but if you're a random person they are SUPER annoying (friends included).\
\
S/O to the subs downvoting me. They insulted EE for 15 min straight and they don't even play pro. I don't even like EE, but come on.
do you REALLY need boots though if you are starving for slots.  everytime i see him he's just jumping and blinking around.
somehow, my brain picked up this\
\
" Why go damage when you can go even more evasive and BUSTY with xxx / shivas (beer) / chixs? Which you can afford with 420 gpm "
&gt;If a player from the #2 team is kicked in favor of a player from #1 team and the kicked dude has to join a 12th ranked team where all his well earned points become meaningless\
\
You start with an "if" and never end up at a "then".\
\
**IF** a player from a #2 team ends up on a #12 team where all his points became meaningless, *then* what? That seems reasonable to me, especially in a game where we see team composition mean so much more than individual skill. Na'Vi at 315 seems reasonable, if Lil is a reasonable boon them, then that 315 should climb.
How is that not broken....
Can I make a joke about .. "Allahu Akbar" here? no? ok sorry bye.
Right click animation is not a reason. in fact puck's right click animation is much better than qop's. Qop has a large backswing btw. \
\
Built in blink vs illusory orb and phase shift.. it's about equal. Dude the puck and qop matchup is a classic one, they are about equal in terms of right click. Puck might currently be better played as an evasive hero, but it's definitely not unthinkable to build it as a right click. Because it's not popular does not mean it does not work... My post is purely theoratical as well, I'm not like saying puck right click should be the proper way to play the hero, i'm just saying it could be pretty viable as puck does have the tools to do it.
Talents were a mistake this is NOT dota anymore

Most overrated ?  Loda, GTFO.
I see your point. But then again: we rather provide a platform than manage who the winner is. The jury nominates, the people vote, the jury selects the winner. Then we take the shitstorm on Reddit in our faces :)\
\
But in any case, like it or not, we will keep working on making this award more relevant and more influential, so all your remarks are being noted.
Maybe because runes are not towers? Hmmmmmmmm?
I didn't know there was any event held in Cannes. What the hell is this site even. And to think you bothered Samy Ouerfelli to be part of this.. lul\
